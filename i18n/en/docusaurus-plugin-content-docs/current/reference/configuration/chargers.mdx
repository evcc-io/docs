# `chargers`

To control the charging process, evcc must be able to communicate with a charger.

A charger must have at least the following configuration:

```yaml
chargers:
  - name: charger1 # reference name
    type: ...
    ...
```

Below, the possible parameters are explained.

---

## Required Parameters

### `name`

A short designation of the charger defined here. The value is used when referencing the charger in the configuration of the [charger](loadpoints#charger).

**For example**:

```yaml
name: charger1
```

---

### `type`

This is the evcc-specific charger type that allows communication with the charger. Known chargers can be integrated using the `template` type. The appropriate (template) type can be found under [devices - chargers](/docs/devices/chargers).

For unknown chargers (or for other individual reasons), the default implementation can be used through [Plugins](/docs/reference/plugins).

**For example**:

```yaml
type: custom
```

---

## Optional Parameters

### `integrateddevice`

This parameter causes chargers that operate without a "vehicle" (e.g. heat pump, eBike) to not display a vehicle, thus omitting vehicle detection.

In connection with this parameter, an icon can also be assigned (see [`vehicle.icon`](/docs/reference/configuration/vehicles#icon)), which will then be displayed at the charger.

**For example**:

```yaml
integrateddevice: true
icon: bike
```

```
