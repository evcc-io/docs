# Dynamic Feed-In

These features are relevant if you have a [dynamic feed-in tariff](../tariffs) (e.g., direct marketing, Netherlands, Australia, etc.).

## Feed-in priority

By default, evcc uses solar surplus first to charge the car.
Only then is the solar energy fed into the grid.
During times of high feed-in rewards, it can be beneficial to prioritize the feed-in and charge the car later.

With the *Feed-in priority* feature, you can set a price threshold per charging point.
When the feed-in tariffs are high (shown as orange bars), charging is paused (**solar mode**) or reduced to a minimum (**min+solar mode**).
