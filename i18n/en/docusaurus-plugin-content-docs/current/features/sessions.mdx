# Charging Sessions

evcc's core task is the intelligent charging of vehicles based on photovoltaics, battery storage and electricity tariffs.
This control takes place automatically and in the background.
So that you can see the effect of these optimizations, we record some measurements during the charging session.

## Current charging session

In the main view you can see information about the current charging session.

1.  **Power:** Shows the current charging power in kW.
The green lightning symbolizes that a charge is active.
Below the power, the number of active phases and their utilization are shown as small green bars.

2.  **Charged:** Shows the amount of energy already charged.
If your wallbox has a meter installed, the values ​​are taken from there.
For wallboxes without a meter, evcc calculates the amount of energy based on the charging power.

3.  **Other values:** Depending on your installation, other measured values ​​are available.
You can select these by clicking on the name.
Alternatively, clicking on the numerical value switches to the next display.

        * **Remaining time:** Shows the time remaining until the charging target is reached.
        If your vehicle supports this, the remaining time is determined from the vehicle data.
        Alternatively, the remaining time is calculated based on the current charging power and the charging target.

        * **Finish time:** Shows the time when the charging target is reached based on the remaining time.
        As with the remaining time, the prerequisite is that the vehicle can determine the remaining time from the vehicle data.

        * **Charging duration:** Shows the effective duration of the charging session.
        If the charging session is paused (e.g. due to PV surplus), the time is stopped.

        * **Solar:** The percentage value shows which proportion of the charged energy comes from the PV system.
        Energy from the home storage is counted as solar energy.

        * **⌀ Price:** Shows the average price per kWh.
        The basis is the current electricity price, the proportion of self-consumption and any lost feed-in tariff.
        Only available if an [dynamic electricity tariff](./dynamic-prices) is configured.

        * **Σ Price:** Total price of the current charging session. The basis is the current electricity price, the share of self-consumption and any lost feed-in tariff.
        Only available if an [dynamic electricity tariff](./dynamic-prices) is configured.

        * **⌀ CO₂:** Shows the average CO₂ emissions per kWh.
        The basis is the share of self-consumption in combination with the CO₂ emissions of the electricity mix.
        Your own solar power (direct PV use and storage) is considered CO₂-free.
        Only available if a [CO₂ source](./co2) is configured.

## List of charging sessions

A charging session in evcc is the period between plugging in the charging cable and unplugging it.
It is quite possible that charging was paused and restarted several times during this period.
charging sessions in which no energy was used are not recorded.

In the menu under "Charging sessions" you will find a list of all previous charging sessions grouped by month.
The data is presented in tabular form and can be exported as a CSV file.
You can filter by charging point and vehicle and view totals and average values.

Note: On smaller screens, a more compact view with fewer columns is shown.
By clicking on the column headings, you can choose which information should be displayed.

## Charging session in detail

Clicking on an entry in the list opens the detailed view of the charging session.
There you can see all available values ​​including the mileage of your vehicle, if available.

If a vehicle was not recognized correctly, you can also correct the vehicle assignment or delete the charging session in this view.

## Switchable sockets

In contrast to wall boxes, there is no way to detect the charging session with switchable sockets (e.g. Schuko charger, e-bike, ...) or hard-wired systems (e.g. heat pump, heating element, ...).
However, these consumers currently appear in the list of charging sessions with long periods of time.
If evcc is restarted, a new charging session is logged.
This can also be done manually by actively stopping and starting at the charging point (mode: off).

The current solution is not optimal for these cases.
In a future release, we will improve the evaluation for switchable sockets and hard-wired systems.
