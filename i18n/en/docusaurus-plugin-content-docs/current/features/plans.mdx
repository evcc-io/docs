# Charge Planner

If you enter **a departure time and a charging goal**, the planning algorithm will automatically find the best loading times.

The planner is only active in Solar and Min+Solar mode.
Self-produced solar energy continues to be preferred.
If your own energy is not enough, the rest is charged from the power grid.
Depending on whether you have one [dynamic electricity tariff](./dynamic-prices) or a data source for [CO₂-predictions](./co2) currently have **three charging strategies**:

1. **Cheap charging** (dynamic electricity tariff available): Vehicle charges in the cheapest hours before departure.
2. **Green charging** (CO₂ forecast available): Vehicle charges in the hours with the lowest CO₂ emissions.
3. **Standard**: The planner charges the required energy in the hours shortly before departure. This means that the vehicle's battery is still warm when you leave and less active heating energy is required.

The loading strategies cannot be selected manually, but are selected automatically based on the stored data source.

## Create charging plan

To set a plan, click on **Plan** at the charging point.
If evcc knows the charge level of your vehicle (online API) and the battery capacity, you can enter the **desired charge level in %** in addition to the departure time in the dialog.
You will be shown a preview of the charging times.
Use the "Active" switch to activate your plan.

## Late charging

With this option, you can specify that a part of the planned charging is moved to shortly before departure.
This is useful for different scenarios:

- **Preconditioning**: In winter, you start your trip with a vehicle that has already been warmed up through the charging process. Reduces active heating energy demand.
- **Climate control**: Ensures that a parallel active climate control of the vehicle is covered by EV charger.
- **Battery care**: For planned long trips, the vehicle does not stand unnecessarily long at a high charge level. Less battery aging.

This option partially overrides the purely cost- or CO₂-based charging strategy.
The late portion can be set individually as needed (30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, all) depending on your needs.

## Repeating plans

You can also create repeating plans.
Define on which **weekdays** the plan should be active.
When multiple plans are active, the next matching time will be used and the plan prognosis will be shown in the diagram.

:::note Note
These state-of-charge based plans are stored per vehicle.
This means you can charge [multiple vehicles](./vehicle#multiple-vehicles) at the same charging point.
The planning of the currently connected vehicle will always be used.

## Energy amount plan

If the charge level and capacity are not known, planning is done by specifying an **energy amount in kWh**.

This plan only applies to the current charging session.
Repeating plans are not available in this mode.
