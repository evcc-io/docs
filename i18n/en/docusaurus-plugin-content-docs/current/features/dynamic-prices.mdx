# Dynamic Tariffs

If your own PV power is not sufficient, the charging power requirement must be covered from time to time by grid power.
If you have an electricity tariff with flexible electricity prices such as [Tibber](https://tibber.com/de/) or [Awattar](https://www.awattar.de/), you can optimize your grid charging with evcc.

## Configure data source

The configuration of electricity prices currently still has to be done via `evcc.yaml`.

### Fixed electricity price

Here is the configuration for a fixed electricity tariff.
This information is used to calculate the actual charging costs.

```yaml
tariffs:
  currency: EUR
  grid:
    type: fixed
    price: 0.32 # EUR/kWh
```

### Time-dependent electricity price

Using `zones` you can specify different prices for certain periods of time.
You can define as many periods as you like in which a different price applies.

```yaml
tariffs:
  currency: EUR
  grid:
    type: fixed
    price: 0.32 # EUR/kWh (default)
    zones:
      - days: Mo-Fr
        hours: 2-6
        price: 0.22 # EUR/kWh (weekdays 2-6 hours)
      - days: Sa,So
        price: 0.12 # EUR/kWh (weekend)
```

### Dynamic electricity price via API

If you have an electricity tariff that follows electricity exchange prices, for example, you can also obtain the prices via an API.
Here is an example configuration for the electricity tariff from [Tibber](https://tibber.com/de/).

```yaml
tariffs:
  grid:
    type: tibber
    token: "..." # Access Token
```

You can find a list of all supported tariffs under [tariffs](../devices/tariffs).
If your provider has an interface but is not yet supported by evcc, please submit a [Feature Request](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/issues/new/choose).

## Cheap grid charging

If you have configured a time-dependent or dynamic electricity tariff, the "Cheap grid charging" section will appear in the settings dialog at the charging point.

Here you can see the energy prices for the coming hours and set a price limit.

/>

This limit applies in **solar mode** of the current charging point.
If you click on "apply everywhere", the limit is applied to all charging points.
In addition to [Solar Surplus Charging](./solar-charging), fast charging is now activated in the hours with low electricity prices (green bars).

## Charging planning

By using [charging plans](./plans) you can regulate your energy costs even more precisely.
All you have to do is enter your energy quantity (kWh) or your target charge level (%) and the desired departure time.
If a time-dependent or dynamic electricity tariff is configured, the planning algorithm automatically selects the cheapest hours for charging.

For the duration of the charging plan, the price limit set in "Cheap grid charging" is overridden.
