# iOS & Android App

The Web UI is the easiest way to use evcc from any device.
But there are some features that are only possible with a native app.

## About the App

There is an official companion app for iOS and Android.
It automatically finds evcc instances in your network and comes with better online/offline detection.
The app adapts the Web UI even better to each device.
Touch interactions are more reliable and the screen space is used more efficiently.
Read more [here](https://github.com/evcc-io/app?tab=readme-ov-file#features).

## Download

The app is available on the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and F-Droid.

## Remote Access

Just like when accessing via browser, you need to be on the same network as your evcc instance when using the app.
For internet access, we recommend using VPN services.
Many routers include such functionality, but services like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) or [ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com/) are also commonly used.

## Perspectives

With the native app, we've created the foundation for future features that aren't possible with the Web UI.
Native push notifications or platform-specific features like widgets will follow sooner or later.
