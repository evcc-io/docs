# Charge Points

## General

### Is my Charge Point supported?

evcc's goal is to bring cheap charging (including via your own PV system) to as many people as possible. Lots of Chargers can be controlled, but sometimes we simply haven't managed to add support yet!

Currently supported Chargers can be found under [Devices / Chargers](/docs/devices/chargers) - hopefully yours is already there!

### Can I use several Chargers at once?

Yes! Multiple Chargers can be added and controlled by evcc at the same time.

However, **_Load Management_ or prioritization across multiple Chargers is currently not supported**. This is currently in development for a later release.

## Single / Three-Phase Functionality

### Is the automatic Single / Three-Phase switching functionality on my Charger supported?

This functionality is supported by evcc on a few Chargers. Have a look in the list of [Supported Chargers](/docs/devices/chargers) to see if it's listed as a feature.

### Manual Single / Three-Phase Switchover

With small PV systems and/or during the winter, it only makes sense to use a single phase to make use of any surplus power as efficiently as possible without incurring network losses.

In the case of Three-Phase Chargers that don't support automatic mode switching, you can disconnect phases 2 & 3 on the incoming supply to your Charge Point using some kind of contactor (e.g Hager HAB304). If full performance is needed, simply switch these phases back on again.

You may need to modify the "Loadpoint" parameter `Phases` to suit your installation. Please see [the documentation](docs/reference/configuration/loadpoints#phases) for more information.

:::danger
For safety reasons, evcc will only disconnect phases from the Charge Point when there is no Vehicle connected.
