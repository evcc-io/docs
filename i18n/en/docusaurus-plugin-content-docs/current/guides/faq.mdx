# Miscellaneous

## Example configurations

### Shelly

In this example of how flexible evcc can be, we control a water heat pump.

"Vehicle State of Charge" is used to show the current temperature of the water.

- Shelly 3EM as the Grid Supply Meter
- Shelly EM as the Charge Meter
- Shelly 1 as the Charger (opens/closes the Call for Water contact)
