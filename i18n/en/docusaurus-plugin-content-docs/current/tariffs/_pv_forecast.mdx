If you configure forecast data, the estimated remaining production for the current day will be shown in the UI.
You also get a forecast chart for the upcoming days.

It is possible to combine **multiple solar forecasts** to cover multiple solar arrays.
The values will be summed up for this purpose.
Use the following syntax:

```yaml
tariffs:
  solar:
    - type: template
      template: ...
      # ...
    - type: template
      template: ...
      # ...
```

Many providers have a rate limit.
Therefore, you may need to increase the update `interval`.
