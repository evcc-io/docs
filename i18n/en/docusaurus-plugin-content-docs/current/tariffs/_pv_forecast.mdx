:::warning Under Development
Currently, PV production forecasts are only consumed and made available via [REST API](/docs/integrations/rest-api) (`/api/state`) and [MQTT API](/docs/integrations/mqtt-api) (`forecast/solar`).

Display of the data in the UI and consideration in the [charging plan](/docs/features/plans) will follow in future releases.
