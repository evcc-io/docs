If you configure forecast data, the estimated remaining production for the current day will be shown in the UI.
You also get a forecast chart for the upcoming days.

It is possible to combine **multiple solar forecasts** to cover multiple solar arrays.
The values will be summed up for this purpose.
Use the following syntax:

```yaml
tariffs:
  solar:
    - type: template
      template: ...
      # ...
    - type: template
      template: ...
      # ...
```

Many providers have a rate limit.
Therefore, you may need to increase the update `interval`.

### Forecast Adjustment

In addition to the forecast, evcc also logs the current solar power and accumulates this over time.
This also happens for the forecast data.
By comparing the two values over time, evcc can adjust the forecasts to match your actual production values.
You can enable and disable this adjustment in the forecast popup in the UI.

If you have problems with the values from this adjustment, you can reset the already captured data.

Procedure:

Stop evcc

then via the CLI:
```bash
# Reset forecasted energy and actual generated energy
evcc settings set solarAccForecast 0
evcc settings set solarAccYield "{}"
```
You will be asked whether you really want to do this and can confirm this with `y`.

Then start evcc again.

Now evcc will start accumulating the forecasts from 0 again.
