# Sponsorship

We at evcc believe in open source software. Our goal is to develop a best-in-class solution for charging Electric Vehicles that interacts with existing hardware and technology.

evcc already supports a long list of Vehicles, Chargers, Meters, Inverters, and Battery systems, with more being added regularly. However, the development and maintenance of evcc is very time consuming - so we are dependent on your support as a community to keep the project going.

evcc is open source, but we also want to encourage manufacturers to provide open source hardware devices, public documentation, and to support open source projects like ourselves that offer additional value for otherwise closed hardware. Where this is not the case, evcc's _Contributor Sponsor Tokens_ need to finance ongoing development and support.

The personal _Contributor Sponsor Token_ requires [GitHub sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/evcc-io). We've chosen to use GitHub sponsors as it's easy to integrate, and does not include commission to be paid by any party. At [sponsor.evcc.io](https://sponsor.evcc.io), the _Contributor Sponsor Token_ can be requested, which is valid for as long as the sponsorship is active, on as many installations as desired - and can be renewed at any time. Simply enter the token in your `evcc.yaml` to unlock the associated functionality, and super-special, super-awesome supporter confetti inside evcc.

Thank you for your support! 💚🎉

GitHub unfortunately no longer accepts PayPal for sponsorship.

If you don't want to use a credit / debit card, please contact us at info@evcc.io

All chargers marked with 💚 in the documentation require a Sponsor Token.
Open-hardware chargers and products with good community karma can be used without a token.
The same applies to manufacturers who actively support evcc development.

## How to Use your Token

Simply add the following line to your `evcc.yaml`:
