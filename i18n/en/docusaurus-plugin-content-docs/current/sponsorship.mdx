# Sponsorship

We at evcc believe in open source software.
Our goal is to enable local, cloud-free, privacy-friendly and manufacturer-independent charging of electric vehicles.
The list of supported devices is growing steadily.
We value an enjoyable user experience while also offering a high degree of flexibility for advanced users.

To ensure the ongoing development, we need your support - financially or through active contribution.

## Community Funding 🤘💚

The code of evcc is open source and available on GitHub.
However, for many commercial EV chargers, we require a sponsor token.
Open-hardware chargers, products with a good community karma and manufacturers who actively support evcc development are supported without a token.
The same applies to simple switch-sockets and plugins.

We want the project to be funded by the community.
This ensures that the project develops according to the needs of its users and is not influenced by large companies or investors.

## Sponsor Tokens

We have chosen to use GitHub Sponsoring, as it is easy to integrate and does not include any commission to be paid by any party.
Your contribution will therefore land directly with the project - without payment or processing fees.

We offer two models:

- **[Monthly 2$](https://github.com/sponsors/evcc-io?frequency=recurring)**: Support the project with a small monthly contribution.
This gives us planning security and you have the freedom to change the sponsorship monthly or stop it at any time.
- **[One-time 100$](https://github.com/sponsors/evcc-io?frequency=one-time)**: For a one-time contribution, you'll receive a sponsor token with unlimited validity.

Your sponsor token can be viewed at [sponsor.evcc.io](https://sponsor.evcc.io).

As a small thank you, you'll receive **digital supporter confetti 🎉** inside evcc and can order a cool set of **evcc stickers ☀️** which we'll ship to you.

## Contributor Tokens

You want to contribute to the development?
We'd love that!
Look at the [list of open issues](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/issues) or [contact us](mailto:info@evcc.io) with concrete ideas on how you'd like to contribute.
Significant contributions to the [documentation](https://github.com/evcc-io/docs) or [translations](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-or-modifying-translations) also qualify for a contributor token.
[Here](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) you'll find more information on how to get started.

As a contributor, we'll issue you an unlimited contributor token.
[Send us a short email](mailto:info@evcc.io) with your GitHub username.

## Trial Token {#trial}

You want to test evcc and check if all your devices are supported?
For that, you can use our test token.
It has a limited validity, but will be regularly renewed.

<SponsorToken />

If everything works, you can later exchange it for a real sponsor token.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### I am now a GitHub Sponsor, how do I get my token?

At [sponsor.evcc.io](https://sponsor.evcc.io) you can view your token(s).

It may take a while (sometimes hours) until we receive the sponsor information from GitHub.
So please be patient and check back later.
In the meantime, you can also work with the test token.
If your token does not appear after a while, [contact us](mailto:info@evcc.io).

Also make sure that you have selected one of the predefined levels when sponsoring.
If you've entered a lower custom amount (e.g. $2 one-time), no token will be created.

#### I have a business and want to use evcc commercially. Can I do that?

Yes, that's no problem.
Your customers will then each need to create a sponsor token.
Alternatively, we can also issue you several sponsor tokens at once and send you an invoice with the corresponding VAT.
[Write us an email](mailto:info@evcc.io) with your requirements and we'll get back to you.

#### How do I enter my token?

The sponsor token is entered in the `evcc.yaml`.
Add a new line with `sponsortoken: <your-token>`.

It is also possible to set the token via the UI on the configuration page.
Note: This entry is stored in the `evcc.db` and takes precedence over the `evcc.yaml`.

#### Can I use my token on multiple installations?

Yes, as long as it's your personal evcc instances, multiple usage is no problem.
We trust you to be honest about that.

#### I lost my token. How do I get a new one?

You can view your token(s) at [sponsor.evcc.io](https://sponsor.evcc.io).

#### Can I sell my token or buy a "used" one?

The tokens are personalized and contain your GitHub username.
Please do not sell them to third parties.
Please do not buy used tokens from third parties via online platforms.
If you want to support the project, please do so directly.

#### I need a longer test time.

If your test token expires and you're not sure if evcc works as expected for you, you can enter a new test token.
We update the test token regularly.

#### My token is not working. What's wrong?

There could be several reasons:

- **Monthly sponsoring expired:** Check your sponsor status at GitHub and [sponsor.evcc.io](https://sponsor.evcc.io).
- **Formatting error:** Check if the token is correctly entered in the `evcc.yaml`.
- **Experimental Config UI:** You have activated the experimental sponsor token feature in Config UI.
In this case the token in your `evcc.yaml` is ignored and only the new database-entry is used.
With [`evcc migrate --reset`](/docs/reference/cli/evcc_migrate) or the deletion of the `evcc.db` you can get back to the old behavior.

If the above does not help, [contact us](mailto:info@evcc.io) and we'll check it out.

#### My sponsor badge on GitHub is no longer displayed.

We cannot influence the display of the sponsor badge on your GitHub profile.
GitHub currently only displays the badge for the first month of sponsoring, even for larger one-time sponsorings.
However, this has no influence on your sponsor status for evcc.
