Switchable Sockets (including smart-home switches) supported by evcc can be operated in one of two modes:

- Charger Mode (default)
- Static-Switch Mode

_Charger Mode_ allows use of the Switchable Socket to control the charging of battery-operated devices such as e-Motorcycles, e-Bikes, etc).
Charging current is measured and displayed by evcc, and the device is considered "charged" when power draw drops to a trickle (i.e `power < standbypower`)

In contrast, _Static-Switch Mode_ can be used to easily control consumers such as heat pumps, air conditioning systems, and more.
The status of the device is determined by whether the Socket is on or off (on = "charging", off = "charged").

:::note
When using _Static-Switch Mode_, it is recommended to define a separate custom _Meter_ in order to display meaningful performance information.
:::

For all Switchable Sockets, the _mode_ depends on how `standbypower` is configured.

If the value of `standbypower` is greater than or equal to 0 (`standbypower >= 0`), then the Socket uses _Charger Mode_,
and the set value is treated as the threshold value (in Watts).
So long as the measured socket power is above this threshold value, the device is treated as "charging". If the power falls below this value (usually when the device is trickle-charging when its battery is full), it is treated as "charged" / complete.

If `standbypower` is set to a negative value, then the Socket uses _Static-Switch Mode_.
:::info
The Charging Point parameter `phases` **must** be set to **1** when using a switchable socket to ensure proper control.

```yaml
# loadpoint describes the charger, charge meter and connected vehicle
loadpoints:
  - title: Shelly # display name for UI
    charger: my_charger # charger
    vehicle: audi
    mode: pv
---
mincurrent: 9 # 9A*220V=1980W minimum charge current (default 6A)
maxcurrent: 10 # 10A*220V=2200W maximum charge current (default 16A)
phases: 1 # ev phases (default 3)
```
