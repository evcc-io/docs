### Custom

Mandatory:

```yaml
chargers:
  - name: my_charger
    type: custom
    status: # charger status A..F
      source: ...
      # ...
    enabled: # charger enabled state (true/false or 0/1)
      source: ...
      # ...
    enable: # set charger enabled state (true/false or 0/1)
      source: ...
      # ...
    maxcurrent: # set charger max current (A)
      source: ...
      # ...
    
```

Optional, additionally add any of the following

```yaml
    ...
    maxcurrentmillis: # set charger max current (mA), maxcurrent: MUST be defined too!
      source: ...
      # ...
    Phases1p3p: # phase switching (1/3)
      source: ...
      # ...
    #1p3p does no longer handle disable/enable. Use tos: true to confirm you understand the consequences
    tos: true
    currents: # to provide the measured charging currents (A)
      - source: ... # source for L1 current
      - source: ... # source for L2 current
      - source: ... # source for L3 current
    power: # to provide the measured charging power (W)
      - source: ...
    features:
      # no vehicle
      - integrateddevice
      # SoC as temperature
      - heating
    icon: ...
    
```
