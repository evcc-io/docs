# Vehicles

To limit vehicle charging to a given State of Charge (SoC), which most Chargers do not have the capability to read,
evcc can directly communicate with the Vehicle, usually via its manufacturer.

The configuration is formatted as follows:

```yaml
vehicles:
  - name: ev
    type: ...
```

All of the Vehicles listed on this page are supported by evcc.
Once you have adapted the code samples to suit your Vehicle(s) in `evcc.yaml`, you can test the connection using the `evcc vehicle` command, which returns the current status of all connected vehicles.
If you just want to test one meter at a time, use `evcc vehicle --name my_swanky_ev`.

```
$ ./evcc vehicle

SoC:           57%
Charge status: B
Charged:       4.7kWh
Capacity:      77kWh
Range:         280km
Odometer:      4131km
```

:::note
The availability and general quality of Vehicle data can vary greatly by manufacturer. If you have persistent issues updating your Vehicle data, please open a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions).

## Tesla

### Fleet API Proxy

You need to generate an `access` and a `refresh` token for communicating with the Tesla API.
For vehicle control, the virtual key must be installed on the vehicle.
See https://tesla.evcc.io.

```yaml
vehicles:
  - name: my_car
    type: template
    template: tesla-proxy

### latest

You need an `access` and a `refresh` token.
Please generate them through [tesla.evcc.io](https://tesla.evcc.io).

**Note:** This is Tesla's officially supported [FleetAPI](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api).

```yaml
vehicles:
  - name: my_car

### legacy

You need to generate an `access` and a `refresh` token for communicating with the Tesla API.

The following apps allow to create these tokens:
- [Auth app for Tesla (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auth-app-for-tesla/id1552058613#?platform=iphone)
- [Tesla Tokens (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.leveugle.teslatokens)
- [Tesla Auth (macOS, Linux)](https://github.com/adriankumpf/tesla_auth)

**Note:** This API is [not officially supported](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com) by Tesla and will be deprecated step by step.
