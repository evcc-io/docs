# Vehicles

To limit vehicle charging to a given State of Charge (SoC), which most Chargers do not have the capability to read,
evcc can directly communicate with the Vehicle, usually via its manufacturer.

The configuration is formatted as follows:

```yaml
vehicles:
  - name: ev
    type: ...
```

All of the Vehicles listed on this page are supported by evcc.
Once you have adapted the code samples to suit your Vehicle(s) in `evcc.yaml`, you can test the connection using the `evcc vehicle` command, which returns the current status of all connected vehicles.
If you just want to test one meter at a time, use `evcc vehicle --name my_swanky_ev`.

```
$ ./evcc vehicle

SoC:           57%
Charge status: B
Charged:       4.7kWh
Capacity:      77kWh
Range:         280km
Odometer:      4131km
```

:::note
The availability and general quality of Vehicle data can vary greatly by manufacturer. If you have persistent issues updating your Vehicle data, please open a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions).

## Hyundai Bluelink

Some models (e.g. Kona) switch internally to 2 phases at low charging currents (< 8A). In cases where the wallbox also measures the phase currents, this leads to undesirable fluctuations in the charging power. The remedy here is to set the minimum charging current to 8A.

## Tesla 

Tesla offers an official, but paid vehicle API.
For private use, you can create a [Tesla Developer Account](https://developer.tesla.com/) and receive a monthly API credit of 10$. This is usually sufficient for the common evcc use cases.

The [myteslamate.com](https://www.myteslamate.com/tesla-api-application-registration/) guide explains the process and generates a free Access and Refresh Token. With this token pair and your Client ID created in the Tesla Developer Account, evcc can directly communicate with the Tesla API. You can see your used credit at Tesla.

To use a Tesla Wall Connector, you need a public Command Proxy Server. [myteslamate.com](https://app.myteslamate.com/) provides this service for 12â¬/year. Configure the Command permissions at myteslamate.com and enter the Proxy Token here. Start, stopp and current commands are sent to Tesla via this proxy.

### ISO15118

Only supported if the vehicle can provide the state of charge (Soc) to the connected charger.
Using ISO15118 with some VW group vehicles, e.g. Porsche Taycan, requires additional configuration in the vehicle.
This requires an active location-based charging profile with the lowest minimum charge (25%) and direct charging disabled.
Otherwise the vehicle cannot be put into sleep mode.

### Tessie

Connect your Tesla using the Tessie API. This will never wake up the car, polling can be set to "always" and interval "1M". If the vehicle is awake, the data is usually less than 15 seconds old. If the vehicle is asleep, the data is from the time the vehicle went to sleep. Get your token at https://dash.tessie.com/settings/api
