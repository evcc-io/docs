# Vehicles

To limit vehicle charging to a given State of Charge (SoC), which most Chargers do not have the capability to read,
evcc can directly communicate with the Vehicle, usually via its manufacturer.

## Setup

**Recommended:** Set up your vehicle directly via the web interface under **Configuration** → **Vehicles**.
Setup is done via a guided wizard.
All devices listed here are selectable via the interface.
After entering all required data, you can test the connection and see which data evcc reads from the device.

**Alternative:** You can also set up your vehicle via the configuration file.
On this page you'll find the YAML configurations for all vehicles currently supported by evcc.

```yaml
vehicles:
  - name: ev
    type: ...
```

Once you have adapted the code sample for your vehicle and added it to `evcc.yaml`, you can test the connection using the `evcc vehicle` command.
This tests all configured vehicles.
With the command `evcc vehicle --name my_ev` you can test selectively using the assigned name.

```
$ ./evcc vehicle

SoC:           57%
Charge status: B
Charged:       4.7kWh
Capacity:      77kWh
Range:         280km
Odometer:      4131km
```

:::note
The availability and general quality of Vehicle data can vary greatly by manufacturer. If you have persistent issues updating your Vehicle data, please open a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions).

## BMW CarData (EU Data Act)

Requires CarData activation in BMW/Mini portal. The following data points need to be configured for streaming access:

```
vehicle.body.chargingPort.status
vehicle.cabin.hvac.preconditioning.status.comfortState
vehicle.drivetrain.batteryManagement.header
vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.charging.hvStatus
vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.charging.status
vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.charging.timeRemaining
vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.kombiRemainingElectricRange
vehicle.powertrain.electric.battery.stateOfCharge.target
vehicle.vehicle.preConditioning.activity
vehicle.vehicle.travelledDistance
```

Data will be updated on restart and when received using streaming. This only happens when the vehicle actively creates new updates.

## Hyundai Bluelink

Instead of your account's password, the password field needs to be filled with a `refresh_token` ([instructions](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/wiki/Hyundai-Kia:-Refresh-Token)).

Some models (e.g. Kona) switch internally to 2 phases at low charging currents (< 8A). In cases where the wallbox also measures the phase currents, this leads to undesirable fluctuations in the charging power. The remedy here is to set the minimum charging current to 8A.

## Mini CarData (EU Data Act)

Requires CarData activation in BMW/Mini portal. The following data points need to be configured for streaming access:

```
vehicle.body.chargingPort.status
vehicle.cabin.hvac.preconditioning.status.comfortState
vehicle.drivetrain.batteryManagement.header
vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.charging.hvStatus
vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.charging.status
vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.charging.timeRemaining
vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.kombiRemainingElectricRange
vehicle.powertrain.electric.battery.stateOfCharge.target
vehicle.vehicle.preConditioning.activity
vehicle.vehicle.travelledDistance
```

Data will be updated on restart and when received using streaming. This only happens when the vehicle actively creates new updates.

## Tesla

Tesla offers an official, but paid vehicle API.
For private use, you can create a [Tesla Developer Account](https://developer.tesla.com/) and receive a monthly API credit of 0.
This is usually sufficient for the common evcc use cases.

The [myteslamate.com](https://www.myteslamate.com/tesla-api-application-registration/) guide explains the process and generates a free Access and Refresh Token.
With this token pair and your Client ID created in the Tesla Developer Account, evcc can directly communicate with the Tesla API.
You can see your used credit in the Tesla Developer Dashboard.

To use a Tesla Wall Connector, you need a public Command Proxy Server.
[myteslamate.com](https://app.myteslamate.com/) provides such a service with per-use pricing.
Configure the Command permissions at myteslamate.com and enter the Proxy Token here.
Start, stopp and current commands are sent to Tesla via this proxy.

More information and alternatives can be found in [our blog post](https://docs.evcc.io/en/blog/2025/01/20/tesla-api-update).

## Volvo

To use with evcc, you need a Volvo account and a Volvo Connected Car API Key.

1. To do this, create a new application on the [Account page](https://developer.volvocars.com/account/) and save the primary VCC API key.
2. Now publish your application and select the **Scope** permissions **Connected Vehicle API:** `conve:vehicle-relation, conve:odometer-status`, **Energy API:** `energy:state:read`.
3. You must enter the URL of your evcc instance as the redirect URL, e.g. `https://evcc.example.org/providerauth/callback`.
4. When adding the vehicle via the UI, an error message is displayed.
5. Open a new tab and go to the evcc configuration page. A button for logging in will appear in the top right menu.
6. Log in with your Volvo account and allow access to the data. If the authorization is successful, the vehicle can be added.

**NOTE:** Volvo enforces re-login every 7 days. Use "hamburger" menu logout/login.

### ISO15118

Only supported if the vehicle can provide the state of charge (Soc) to the connected charger.
Using ISO15118 with some VW group vehicles, e.g. Porsche Taycan, requires additional configuration in the vehicle.
This requires an active location-based charging profile with the lowest minimum charge (25%) and direct charging disabled.
Otherwise the vehicle cannot be put into sleep mode.
