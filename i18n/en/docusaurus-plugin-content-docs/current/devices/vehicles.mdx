# Vehicles

To limit vehicle charging to a given State of Charge (SoC), which most Chargers do not have the capability to read,
evcc can directly communicate with the Vehicle, usually via its manufacturer.

The configuration is formatted as follows:

```yaml
vehicles:
  - name: ev
    type: ...
```

All of the Vehicles listed on this page are supported by evcc.
Once you have adapted the code samples to suit your Vehicle(s) in `evcc.yaml`, you can test the connection using the `evcc vehicle` command, which returns the current status of all connected vehicles.
If you just want to test one meter at a time, use `evcc vehicle --name my_swanky_ev`.

```
$ ./evcc vehicle

SoC:           57%
Charge status: B
Charged:       4.7kWh
Capacity:      77kWh
Range:         280km
Odometer:      4131km
```

:::note
The availability and general quality of Vehicle data can vary greatly by manufacturer. If you have persistent issues updating your Vehicle data, please open a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions).

## Hyundai Bluelink

Some models (e.g. Kona) switch internally to 2 phases at low charging currents (< 8A). In cases where the wallbox also measures the phase currents, this leads to undesirable fluctuations in the charging power. The remedy here is to set the minimum charging current to 8A.

## Mercedes-Benz 

The configuration of the Mercedes-Benz integration is only possible in yaml mode.
Procedure:
  1. add the configuration to evcc.yaml (without token)
    ```
    vehicles:
      - name: my_car
        type: mercedes
        account: # Mercedes Me user-Id (email)
        region: # MB me region (EMEA, APAC, NORAM)
        vin: W... # Required, if more then one car is registered in this account
        capacity: 50 # capacity in kWh (optional)
    ```
  2. Token generation: execute `./evcc token mercedes` or `evcc token [name]`, when name is defined
  3. insert the tokens into evcc.yaml
    ```
    vehicles:
      - name: my_car
        type: mercedes
        account: # Mercedes Me user-id (email)
