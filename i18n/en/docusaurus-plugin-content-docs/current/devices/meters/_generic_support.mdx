```

:::note
`limitsoc` is set to the current value of `soc` by evcc to block further discharge of a battery e.g. for quick charging.
Alternatively you can configure `batterymode` and have an external control take care of the charging or discharging of the battery based on the given mode.
When `soc` and `limitsoc` are configured `batterymode` will be ignored.
