```

:::note
`limitsoc` is set to the current value of 'soc' by EVCC to block further discharge of a battery e.g. for quick charging. Alternatively you can configure `batterymode` and have an external control take care of the charging or discharging of the battery based on the given mode. When `soc` and `limitsoc` are configured `batterymode` will be ignored.
