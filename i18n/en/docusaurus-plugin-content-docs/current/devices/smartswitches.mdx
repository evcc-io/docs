# Smart Switches

evcc supports smart sockets and controllable switches.
These switches work similarly to EV chargers, but without the power control.
Here, evcc only controls the on/off state of the socket.
If there is enough [surplus](/docs/features/solar-charging) or [cheap energy](/docs/features/dynamic-prices) available, the socket is switched automatically.
Additionally, manual control via "Off" and "Fast" is possible.

## Modes

Depending on the application, there are two modes of operation.
These are set implicitly via the `standbypower` parameter on the device.

### Charging mode (default)

This mode is suitable for the use of sockets that control battery-powered vehicles (e-motorcycles, e-bikes, tool batteries, ...).
The measured charging power at the switch is considered as charging power.
If this power falls below a threshold (default: `standbypower: 15`), evcc considers the device as charged.
This mode is active if the configured value for `standbypower` is not negative.

Here is an example of a Tasmota socket that is operated in charging mode.
The connected charger has a standby consumption of a maximum of 50 W.

```yaml
chargers:
  - name: e_bike_outlet
    type: template
    template: tasmota
    host: 192.0.2.1
    standbypower: 50
```

This means that in this mode the state of the charger is determined by the measured power:

- Charging: (power > `standbypower`)
- Charged: (power ≤ `standbypower`)

:::note
This mode assumes that the switch also has an integrated energy meter.
It is currently not possible to achieve this behavior with an additional [energy meter](/docs/devices/meters) at the charger.
:::

### Static mode

This mode is suitable for general consumers such as heat pumps, air conditioners, heaters, etc.
This mode is activated by a negative value for `standbypower`.

Here is an example of a Shelly switch that controls a heat pump with 5 kW power.

```yaml
chargers:
  - name: my_sg_ready
    type: template
    template: shelly
    host: 192.0.2.2
    standbypower: -5000
```

The state of the charger is directly dependent on the switch state of the socket:

- Charging: switch on
- Charged: switch off

evcc assumes a constant power that is set by the `standbypower` parameter.
In the example above the switch controls a 5 kW heat pump.

If you want to see the real power consumption it is recommended to add a separate [energy meter](./meters) to the charging point.

## Special behavior

### No automatic sessions

In evcc the period from plugging in a vehicle to disconnecting is considered a charging session.
This concept does not work with switches, as these cannot detect a connected/disconnected state.
Therefore, evcc logs the consumption at switches as a long charging process that runs from the start to the end of evcc.
There is currently no purely time-based evaluation.
There are plans to implement this in the future.

However, there is already a way to manually create a charging sessions.
When switching the charging point to **Off** at a switch, the current charging session is stopped.
You can manually start a charging session by switching on and off via the UI.
You could automate this via API (e.g. every night).

### Integrated device

By default, charging points offer the possibility of vehicle assignment.
In many switch scenarios this is not desired.
It makes little sense to connect the Tesla to the SG-Ready contact of a heat pump.
By setting the `features`-flag `integrateddevice` you disable the manual vehicle assignment in the UI.
Additionally, the automatic vehicle detection is disabled for this charging point.

### Heating

If you use the switch to control a heat pump, you should set the `features`-Flag `heating`.
This changes the display in the UI.
Now the status uses the word "heating" instead of "charging".
Additionally, the `soc` of the charger (if available) is no longer displayed in % but as a temperature in °C.
