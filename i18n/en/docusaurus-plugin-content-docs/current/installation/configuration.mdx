# Configuration

After installing evcc, you can configure your devices and settings.
The recommended way is configuration through the web interface.
File-based configuration is also available for advanced users.

## via Web Interface

:::tip Recommended
The web interface is the easiest and fastest way to set up evcc. No configuration files needed!
:::

### Getting Started

1. **Start evcc**: After [installation](../installation), start evcc according to the instructions for your system
2. **Open browser**: Go to `http://<your-ip>:7070` (e.g., `http://evcc.local:7070` or `http://192.168.1.50:7070`)
3. **Set administrator password**: On first start, you'll be prompted to set a password
4. **Setup**: Follow the instructions on the welcome page

### Adding Devices

In the configuration area, you can set up the following components:

- **Charging & Heating** (required): Wallboxes and heat pumps – at least one device must be configured
- **Grid** (recommended): Grid connection meter and electricity tariffs – important for proper energy management
- **Solar & Battery** (optional): Solar systems and battery storage
- **Vehicles** (optional): Vehicle integrations for battery capacity and state of charge, enables smarter charging

### Integrations

Additionally, you can integrate various services and protocols:

- **MQTT**: Data exchange with other systems on the network
- **Messaging**: Push notifications and email alerts
- **InfluxDB**: Data export for long-term analysis
- **EEBus**: Communication with other EEBus devices
- **OCPP Server**: Connection with OCPP-capable wallboxes
- **Circuits**: Circuit monitoring and control
- **Modbus Proxy**: Multiple access to Modbus devices
- **Sunny Home Manager**: Integration via SEMP protocol
- **HEMS**: External control and grid operator integration

### Backup & Restore

The web interface offers integrated data backup functions:

- **Backup**: Download database for data backup
- **Restore**: Restore data from a backup file
- **Reset**: Delete configuration or charging history

## via Configuration File

:::info For Advanced Users
This method uses an `evcc.yaml` file and requires knowledge of command line and YAML files. For special use cases and maximum control.
:::

### From Scratch

You can also create the `evcc.yaml` file manually.
Here you'll find a minimal template that you can use as a starting point.

#### Creation

Copy the content into a new `evcc.yaml` file.

```yaml title="evcc.yaml"
## minimal configuration example

site:
  title: Home # display name for UI
  meters:
    grid: my_grid
    pv:
      - my_pv
    battery:
      - my_battery

# define your loadpoints according your needs
# see https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/reference/configuration/loadpoints
loadpoints:
  - title: Garage # display name for UI
    charger: my_charger # charger
    vehicle: my_car # default vehicle

# meter definitions
# name can be freely chosen and is used as reference when assigning meters to site and loadpoints
# for documentation see https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/meters
meters:
  # replace with your real grid meter
  - name: my_grid
    type: template
    template: demo-meter
    usage: grid
    power: -1000 # 1 kW feed-in
  # replace with your real solar system
  - name: my_pv
    type: template
    template: demo-meter
    usage: pv
    power: 4000 # 4 kW production
  # replace with your real battery
  - name: my_battery
    type: template
    template: demo-battery
    usage: battery
    power: -1000 # 1 kW battery charging
    soc: 50 # 50 % state of charge

# replace with your real charger
# see https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/chargers
chargers:
  - name: my_charger
    type: template
    template: demo-charger
    status: C # charging
    power: 2000 # 2 kW charging power
    enabled: true # optional

# replace with your real vehicle (optional)
# see https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles
vehicles:
  - name: my_car
    type: template
    template: offline
    title: blue e-Golf
    capacity: 50 # in kWh

# enter your real grid tariff and feed-in price
# see https://docs.evcc.io/docs/tariffs
tariffs:
  currency: EUR
  grid:
    type: fixed
    price: 0.29 # EUR/kWh
  feedin:
    type: fixed
    price: 0.10 # EUR/kWh
```

You can start evcc with this file.
Use the respective instructions for your system.

#### Testing

Restart evcc and open your browser at `http://<evcc-ip>:7070`.
Check if the values are plausible.
If you receive an error message, check your entries.

Often these are indentation or typing errors.
The file is written in [YAML format](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
You can use the online tool [YAML Lint](https://www.yamllint.com/) to check if your file follows the correct format.

#### Customizing

The file only contains demo devices (`demo-charger`, `demo-meter`, `demo-battery`, `offline`).
These have fixed values.
Go through the file step by step and adjust the values to your setup:

- Replace the demo devices with your own [meters](../devices/meters), [wallboxes](../devices/chargers), and [vehicles](../devices/vehicles).
- If you don't have a battery, you can remove that section completely.
- If you have multiple solar systems, you can duplicate the corresponding sections.
- If you have multiple wallboxes, copy the loadpoint and charger sections and adjust the names.

Note that the individual entries reference each other.
In the `site` entry (`meters`), the meters (`grid`, `pv`, `battery`) are assigned to their roles.
The `name` field is always used for this.
Names must therefore be unique.

Make these changes step by step if possible.
Restart evcc after each change and check the output in the browser.
This way you'll quickly notice if you've made a mistake.

#### Further Information

The [evcc.dist.yaml](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/evcc.dist.yaml) in the main project contains a complete list of all possible configuration options.
More detailed explanations of the options can be found under [Reference → evcc.yaml](../reference/configuration).

If you want to see a dynamic demo, you can also look at the contents of the [demo.yaml](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/cmd/demo.yaml) file.
This file contains JavaScript-based demo devices that simulate limited functionality.
It is also used for [demo.evcc.io](https://demo.evcc.io).

To run your own installation in demo mode, just start evcc with the parameter `--demo`.
See [CLI Reference](/docs/reference/cli/evcc) for more information.

### With Assistant

Using the `evcc configure` command, you can create a configuration file through a terminal-based assistant.
You can configure your devices through an interactive question-and-answer dialog.

:::warning
The `evcc configure` assistant is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming version. We recommend configuration through the web interface.
:::

#### Prerequisites

To use the assistant, evcc must be installed on your system.
You also need to be able to run the `evcc` command from the command line (terminal, shell, command prompt).
If evcc is running on a system where you don't have this access (e.g., Home Assistant, Docker), you unfortunately cannot use the assistant.

:::note
`evcc configure` can also be started in a Docker container.
See the explanation in [Docker](./docker).
:::

#### Running the Assistant

Start the configuration and follow the prompts in the terminal window:

```sh
evcc configure
```

You should see output similar to the following:

![evcc configure](./screenshots/configure.webp)

After completing the configuration, an `evcc.yaml` file will be created in the current directory.

:::note
With `--advanced` you can start the assistant in an advanced mode.
This will give you additional configuration options.
However, this is not necessary for your first configuration.

```sh
evcc configure --advanced
```

:::

Test if the configuration works:

```sh
evcc -c evcc.yaml
```

Open a browser and enter the URL: `http://<your-ip>:7070` (e.g., `http://evcc.local:7070`).
The evcc interface should now show your own devices.

If everything works, you can move your `evcc.yaml` to the location required for your installation.

### Troubleshooting

If errors occur, you can get additional information using the following commands.

- Syntax check

  ```sh
  evcc -c evcc.yaml checkconfig
  ```

- Meters (Grid, Solar, Battery)

  ```sh
  evcc -c evcc.yaml -l debug meter
  ```

- Vehicles

  ```sh
  evcc -c evcc.yaml -l debug vehicle
  ```

- Wallboxes

  ```sh
  evcc -c evcc.yaml -l debug charger
  ```

Check the output of each command for plausibility.

You can also run `evcc configure` again and correct your entries.
Note that the assistant always creates a completely new configuration.
Targeted modification of an existing configuration is not possible.
Use manual configuration for this.
