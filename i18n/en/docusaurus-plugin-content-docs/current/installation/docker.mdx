# Docker / containerd

evcc can be installed as a Docker / Container image. This also works on some common NAS systems, such as Synology.

:::important
Using Docker can require some more advanced system knowledge - beginners might want to stick to one of the other installation options.

This guide refers specifically to Docker / Synology. Details may differ with other systems, such as cri and podman.
:::

:::warning
Some devices and communication options won't work without specialized docker configuration options, which may not be covered in this guide.
:::warning

:::tip
It's a good idea to test your configuration and setup in a non-docker environment first, to rule out any issues not related to containerisation.
:::

:::note
At the moment, only the following CPU architectures are supported:

* AMD64
* ARMv6
* aarch64
:::

## Configuration

1. It's best to start with a known-working evcc setup using one of the other installation methods:

   - [Debian, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi](linux)
   - [macOS](macos)
   - [Manual Installation (including Windows)](manual)

   :::note
   Where possible, we recommend carrying out this initial setup on the same system that you plan to run containerised evcc on.
   :::

2. If necessary, copy your resulting `evcc.yaml` to the system that you intend to run Containerised evcc on.
3. Create a directory to store evcc's SQLite database (e.g `~/.evcc`).

## Installation

The Container can either be created manually via the command line, or using a `docker-compose` file.

### Command Line

Start the container using one of the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="docker">
  <TabItem value="default" label="Standard" default>

```sh
docker run \
-d \
--name evcc \
-v $(pwd)/evcc.yaml:/etc/evcc.yaml \
-v $(pwd)/.evcc:/root/.evcc \
-p 7070:7070 \
-p 8887:8887 \
-p 7090:7090/udp \
-p 9522:9522/udp \
evcc/evcc:latest
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sma" label="SMA devices and EEBus">
  evcc requires a static Machine ID when using SMA Sunny Home Manager. If this applies to you, append the following to your command:

```
--network host
-v /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id \
```

Alternatively, you can define a Machine ID under the `plant` key in your `evcc.yaml`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
The following image tags are used:
* `evcc/evcc:latest` for the current stable release. (recommended)
* `evcc/evcc:nightly` for the latest, potentially unstable build.
:::

:::note
Depending on your installation, you may need to prepend `docker` commands with `sudo`.
:::

:::note
The `-d` flag will automatically destroy the evcc container once it has stopped. You'll then need to relaunch it again with the same command.
:::

:::warning
**Never** mount the host's `/etc` directory as a volume to the container, only specific configuration files!
:::

### With [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) has some useful advantages over using the command line, especially if you want to combine other applications (such as træfik) with evcc.

Simply copy the following configuration into a `docker-compose.yaml` in your working directory:

<Tabs groupId="docker">
  <TabItem value="default" label="Standard" default>

    version: "3"
    services:
      evcc:
        command:
          - evcc
        container_name: evcc
        image: evcc/evcc:latest
        ports:
          - 7070:7070/tcp
          - 8887:8887/tcp
          - 7090:7090/udp
          - 9522:9522/udp
        volumes:
          - /etc/evcc.yaml:/etc/evcc.yaml
          - /home/[user]/.evcc:/root/.evcc
        restart: unless-stopped

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sma" label="SMA Geräte und EEBus">

       network_mode: host
       volumes:
          - /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id
          - /var/lib/dbus/machine-id:/var/lib/dbus/machine-id

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now start the container:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will remain in the background until you stop it.

## Useful Commands

- Show all containers:

  ```sh
  docker ps -a
  ```

- Get the logs from the evcc container:

  ```sh
  docker logs evcc
  ```

- Validate the meter configuration:

  ```sh
  docker exec evcc evcc -l debug meter
  ```

- Validate the charger configuraiton:

  ```sh
  docker exec evcc evcc -l debug charger
  ```

- Validate the vehicle configuration:

  ```sh
  docker exec evcc evcc -l debug vehicle
  ```

You should be able to find the evcc interface at `http://127.0.0.1:7070`.

:::note
Replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address or hostname of the system you're running evcc on, if appropriate.
:::

## Upgrades

To update to the latest version of evcc, follow this guide:

- Open a Terminal

- Get the latest release of evcc (changing the tag if appropriate):

  ```sh
  docker pull evcc/evcc:latest
  ```

- Stop and remove the evcc container:

  ```sh
  docker stop evcc
  docker rm evcc
  # or
  docker-compose down
  ```

- Restart the container using the appropriate incantation above.

## NAS systems

### Synology NAS

You can install evcc via Docker on Synology NAS systems using its graphical interface, without using the command line.
You'll be given the choice of two network modes: bridge, or host. Whether the Bridge mode can be used depends on what components you're using, and how they communicate with your equipment.
In case of doubt, use host mode. Further information can be found in this useful PDF:

#### QNAP NAS

Installing evcc on QNAP systems via Docker is very similar to the above Synology instructions.
Further QNAP specific instructions can be found here:
