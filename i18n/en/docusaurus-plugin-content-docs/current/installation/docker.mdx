# Docker

evcc can be installed as a Docker image.
Currently, we provide Docker images for AMD64, armv6 and arm64.
Common use cases include NAS systems like Synology, QNAP, Unraid and TrueNAS.

:::important
This guide assumes basic experience with Docker.
If you haven't worked with Docker before, we recommend a direct installation as described in the [Linux](./linux) or [macOS](./macos) guide.

If your devices are not accessible via network (e.g. RS485 adapters) you should also choose the direct installation.
There are technical solutions to implement this with Docker.
However, these are not covered here.
:::

## Preparation

### Configuration File

You need an `evcc.yaml` configuration file for your components (meters, wallbox, vehicle, ...).
There are several ways to create this:

1. **Assistant on another system:** Run `evcc configure` beforehand on a [Linux](./linux), [macOS](./macos) or [Windows](./windows) system.
  Use the created `evcc.yaml` file for your Docker installation.

2. **Manual:** Create the `evcc.yaml` manually.
  You can find instructions under [Configuration](./configuration).

3. **Assistant in Docker:**
  Handy if you have Docker installed on a Linux system.
  Create an empty `evcc.yaml` file and run the configuration assistant directly in Docker.
  Follow the assistant's questions.
  At the end, the configuration will be written to the created `evcc.yaml` file.

    ```sh
    touch evcc.yaml
    docker run -v $(pwd)/evcc.yaml:/app/evcc.yaml -it evcc/evcc:latest evcc configure
    ```

### Volumes

The evcc Docker container needs two volumes:

- `/etc/evcc.yaml` for the configuration file
- `/root/.evcc/` directory for the internal SQLite database. The database is automatically stored in this directory.

Create these directories on your host system.
In this guide we use the paths `/home/user/.evcc/` and `/home/user/evcc.yaml` as examples.

## Installation

This section describes three ways to install evcc using Docker:
Via Docker UI, Docker CLI, and Docker Compose.

### via a Docker UI

If you have a system with a Docker UI (e.g. Synology, QNAP, Portainer, Unraid, ...), you can also perform the installation through this interface.
Here are the relevant details you need to enter:

#### Available Docker Images {#images}

- `evcc/evcc:latest` (recommended)
- `evcc/evcc:nightly` (development build)

#### Volume Mounts {#volumes}

| Host Path              | Container Path   | Description                    |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| `/home/user/evcc.yaml` | `/etc/evcc.yaml` | Configuration file             |
| `/home/user/.evcc/`    | `/root/.evcc`    | Directory for internal database|

#### Ports {#ports}

| Host Port | Container Port | Description             | Optional |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|----------|
| 7070      | 7070/tcp       | Web UI, API             |          |
| 8887      | 8887/tcp       | OCPP Server             | Yes      |
| 9522      | 9522/udp       | SMA Sunny Home Manager  | Yes      |
| 7090      | 7090/udp       | KEBA Chargers           | Yes      |
| 5353      | 5353/udp       | mDNS                    | Yes      |
| 4712      | 4712/tcp       | EEBus                   | Yes      |
| 8899      | 8899/udp       | Modbus UDP              | Yes      |

Open your system's Docker UI and create a new container with the above settings and start it.

The exact field labels vary from system to system.
However, you'll find the concepts of ports and volumes in all systems.

Skip to the [Testing](#test) section to verify the installation.

#### Updates

The update process depends on your specific Docker UI.
Please refer to your system's documentation for this.

:::note
If after an update your charging sessions are no longer displayed, the `/root/.evcc` directory is not mounted correctly.
:::

### via Docker CLI

Install and start the Docker container that matches your component configuration using one of the following commands.
Whether you need `sudo` depends on your system.

<Tabs groupId="docker">
  <TabItem value="default" label="Standard" default>

```sh
sudo docker run -d --name evcc \
-v /home/user/evcc.yaml:/etc/evcc.yaml \
-v /home/user/.evcc:/root/.evcc \
-p 7070:7070 \
-p 8887:8887 \
evcc/evcc:latest
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sma" label="SMA Devices and EEBus">

```sh
sudo docker run -d --name evcc \
-v /home/user/evcc.yaml:/etc/evcc.yaml \
-v /home/user/.evcc:/root/.evcc \
-p 7070:7070 \
-p 8887:8887 \
# highlight-start
-p 9522:9522/udp \
-p 4712:4712 \
--network host \
-v /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id \
# highlight-end
evcc/evcc:latest
```

Set the network mode to `host`.
The SMA Sunny Home Manager requires a unique device ID.
On Linux, you can mount `machine-id` into the container.
Alternatively, you can specify an ID in the `plant` parameter in `evcc.yaml`.

:::note NOTE
The above example only uses basic ports.
Please refer to the [Ports](#ports) section and add additional ports as needed.
:::

### via Docker Compose

[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) has several advantages over direct command line execution.
All parameters are stored in a file.
Additionally, you can configure and start other programs like Traefik in conjunction with evcc.
Simply create a configuration file named `compose.yml` in your active directory.
Copy one of the following configurations matching your component setup into `compose.yml` and save it:

<Tabs groupId="compose">
  <TabItem value="default" label="Standard" default>

```yaml
services:
  evcc:
    command:
      - evcc
    container_name: evcc
    image: evcc/evcc:latest
    ports:
      - 7070:7070/tcp
      - 8887:8887/tcp
    volumes:
      - /home/user/evcc.yaml:/etc/evcc.yaml
      - /home/user/.evcc:/root/.evcc
    restart: unless-stopped
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sma" label="SMA Devices and EEBus">

```yaml
services:
  evcc:
    command:
      - evcc
    container_name: evcc
    image: evcc/evcc:latest
    ports:
      - 7070:7070/tcp
      - 8887:8887/tcp
      - 9522:9522/udp
      - 4712:4712/tcp
    volumes:
      - /home/user/evcc.yaml:/etc/evcc.yaml
      - /home/user/.evcc:/root/.evcc
      - /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id
      - /var/lib/dbus/machine-id:/var/lib/dbus/machine-id
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note NOTE
The above example only uses basic ports.
Please refer to the [Ports](#ports) section and add additional ports as needed.
:::


Start the container with:

```sh
sudo docker compose up -d
```

#### Updates

Navigate to the directory containing the evcc `compose.yml` file.

Update to the latest evcc image:

```sh
sudo docker compose pull
```

If a new image is available, the following command will restart the container - otherwise, the existing one will continue running:

```sh
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

## Testing {#test}

After successfully creating and starting your container, you can access the evcc Web UI at `http://<host>:7070`.
`<host>` is the IP address or hostname of the computer running the container.

You should see the evcc interface and be prompted to set an administration password.

If you cannot establish a connection, check your container logs.
If you see the interface but an error message is displayed, check the configuration in the `evcc.yaml` file.
You can find more details in [Configuration](./configuration) or in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions).

### Synology NAS

You can install evcc via Docker on Synology NAS systems using its graphical interface, without using the command line.
You'll be given the choice of two network modes: bridge, or host. Whether the Bridge mode can be used depends on what components you're using, and how they communicate with your equipment.
In case of doubt, use host mode. Further information can be found in this instruction:

### QNAP NAS

Installing evcc on QNAP systems via Docker is very similar to the above Synology instructions.
