# Proxmox

Proxmox is a virtualisation platform which enables very simple evcc hosting.
If you plan to run evcc on a Linux Home server, Proxmox can be a flexible alternative, which makes it possible to install other systems in addition to evcc.
An evcc installation on [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) then behaves exactly the same way as an installation on a dedicated Linux server.

The following installation has been tested with Ubuntu 24.4.

## Manual Installation

1. If not already present on your system, load a current Ubuntu template onto your server.
2. Create a Debian based LX container that is configured with minimal resources.
   (8G of disk and 512MB of RAM are plenty of resources)

   See screenshot:

3. Install evcc as described in the instructions for Debian-based Linux systems [Debian, Ubuntu Installation](./linux).
4. Update evcc via the Debian package management.

## Using Helper Script

If you prefer to use a script for the installation, copy the bash script under the following link
[Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=evcc) into the Proxmox console.

This way creates a container with 1 GB RAM and since evcc is already installed, you can start directly
with the configuration wizard. There are also other useful scripts on this page, e.g. for backups to external systems.
