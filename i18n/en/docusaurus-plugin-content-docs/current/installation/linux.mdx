# Linux

This guide describes installation for apt-based Linux distributions like Debian and Ubuntu.

:::tip Raspberry Pi
For Raspberry Pi, we recommend the easier installation with [evcc Linux Image](./linux-image).
:::

:::note
For other Linux distributions, see the [Docker](./docker) guide or [Manual Installation](#manual) section.
:::

## Installation

- Open a terminal
- Install required dependencies:

  ```sh
  sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
  ```

- Add the evcc APT repository:

<Tabs groupId="release-type">
  <TabItem value="Release" label="Release" default>
  Current stable release

```sh
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.evcc.io/public/evcc/stable/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Nightly" label="Nightly">
  Development release. Updated daily. May be unstable.

```sh
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.evcc.io/public/evcc/unstable/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

- Update the package list:

  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  ```

- Install evcc:

  ```sh
  sudo apt install -y evcc
  ```

- Start the evcc server:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start evcc
  ```

- Now check the installation by opening a browser to `http://localhost:7070`. The evcc application will ask you to set a password and start the configuration.

- Stop the server:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop evcc
  ```

:::note
During installation, a user `evcc` is created, so ensure the logged-in user does not have the name `evcc`.
:::

:::note
If a serial interface is used, it may be necessary to run the command `sudo usermod -a -G plugdev evcc`.
This command adds the user `evcc` to the `plugdev` group.
The `plugdev` group is used to grant access to plug-in devices (like USB, serial interface, etc.) without requiring root privileges.
:::

## Configuration

A **working** evcc configuration is required.
The configuration contains general settings and definitions for individual components (meters, wallboxes, vehicles, ...).

### Create

We recommend using the configuration wizard:

- Start the configuration wizard and answer the questions:

```sh
sudo evcc configure
```

- Move the created configuration file to `/etc/evcc.yaml`:

```sh
sudo mv evcc.yaml /etc
```

- Restart the evcc server:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart evcc
```

- Access the evcc interface at [http://localhost:7070](http://localhost:7070)

### Modify

If your configuration needs adjustments, you can either rerun the configuration wizard (see above) or manually edit the configuration file.

- Edit the configuration file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/evcc.yaml
```

- Restart the evcc server:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart evcc
```

For more information and examples on configuring evcc, see [Configuration](./configuration).

## Upgrades

To update to the latest version of evcc, follow this guide:

- Check the [releases](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/releases) for breaking changes (BC) for your installation
- Open a terminal
- Update the package list:

  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  ```

- Upgrade evcc:

  ```sh
  sudo apt --only-upgrade install -y evcc
  ```

:::info
If the unstable repository (nightly versions) has been added, the update will always be updated to the latest available nightly version. If this is no longer desired, the unstable repository can be removed using `sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/evcc-unstable.list`.
:::

## Downgrade

If you need to go backwards for any reason, you can do so with this command:

```sh
  sudo apt install evcc=x.xxx.x # Version Number
```

## System Service {#systemd}

evcc runs as a background system service. Here's some useful commands to control it:

```sh
sudo systemctl status evcc # shows status
sudo systemctl start evcc # start the service, if it isn't already running
sudo systemctl stop evcc # stops the service
sudo systemctl restart evcc # restart the service
sudo systemctl enable evcc # sets the service to run at boot
sudo systemctl disable evcc # stops the service running at boot
```

## Testing

Check the installation

- Show the running evcc service:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl status evcc
  ```

- Check the latest log entries of the evcc service:

  ```sh
  sudo journalctl -u evcc --since "yesterday"
  ```

- Validate the meter configuration:

  ```sh
  sudo evcc -l debug meter
  ```

- Validate the charger configuration:

  ```sh
  sudo evcc -l debug charger
  ```

- Validate the vehicle configuration:

  ```sh
  sudo evcc -l debug vehicle
  ```

Open a browser and enter the following URL: `http://127.0.0.1:7070`.

:::note
Replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address or hostname of the computer if the browser is not opened on the same computer.
:::

## Backup and Restore

To restore the "original state" after a reinstallation, it is sufficient to back up the configuration file `evcc.yaml` and the database file `evcc.db`.
The storage location is specified in the log file at program start.
Typically, the configuration is located under `/etc/evcc.yaml` and the database under `/var/lib/evcc/evcc.db`.

Both files can be copied using the Linux command `cp`.

Example (copying from the usual storage location to the home directory):

Copy yaml: `sudo cp /etc/evcc.yaml /home/pi/evcc.yaml.bak`

Copy db: `sudo cp /var/lib/evcc/evcc.db /home/pi/evcc.db.bak`

## Manual Installation {#manual}

In addition to the Debian/Ubuntu APT package, we also provide other binaries for Linux.

### Installation

- Download the appropriate file for your system:
  - 64-bit Intel CPU: [evcc_X.XX_linux_amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/releases/latest)
  - 64-bit ARM CPU: [evcc_X.XX_linux_arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/releases/latest)
  - 32-bit ARM CPU (e.g. Raspberry Pi 32-bit OS): [evcc_X.XX_linux_armv6.tar.gz](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/releases/latest)

- Extract the downloaded file (e.g., by double-clicking).
- The extracted folder contains an `evcc` program.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the new folder.
- Check if evcc works with this command:
  ```
  ./evcc -v
  ```
- You should see the current version of evcc (e.g., `evcc version 0.xxx.y`).

### Configuration

Create a working `evcc.yaml` configuration file following the [Configuration](./configuration) guide.
You can start it with this command:

```sh
./evcc -c evcc.yaml
```

### Upgrade/Downgrade

Follow the steps above and replace the evcc program file with the new or previous version.
The configuration does not need to be redone.

### Setting up the Service

For production use, you'll want to set up evcc as a system service.
This ensures evcc starts when the computer boots and automatically restarts in case of errors.

:::note
This documentation assumes Linux supports `systemd`.
