Starting with evcc v0.133, a [Tesla Developer Account](https://developer.tesla.com/) is required.
The usage remains free of charge, but requires an additional setup step.

:::note Update
8.2.2025: More detailed instructions for the Tesla Fleet API and myteslamate.com configuration.
:::

## Paid Tesla Fleet API starting February

Last year we integrated the [Tesla Fleet API](/blog/2024/02/01/v0.124-new-tesla-api) into evcc.
Tesla was the first manufacturer to provide an official and above all open API for communication with their vehicles.

Tesla had already announced that this API would not stay free of charge.
The prices are now known and will come into effect starting February 1, 2025.
The billing is based on usage, with costs varying depending on the type of request.

With [tesla.evcc.io](https://tesla.evcc.io) we have provided a service that allows evcc users to generate access tokens for API usage.
The API communication of these tokens would be billed to us starting February 2025.
The costs per user depend on the number of vehicles, charging behavior, and the specific configuration of the update interval.
For most users, these costs exceed our "$2 im Monat" sponsoring model and would not be sustainable for us, even if we would require sponsorship for Tesla integration.

## Free API credit for private users

Tesla offers private users a monthly API credit of $10, which should be sufficient for most evcc users.

[![Tesla's API credit](./tesla-credit-en.png)](https://developer.tesla.com/)

With the version 0.133, we have adapted the API communication to Tesla so that you can use your own Tesla Developer Account.
Old tokens generated with [tesla.evcc.io](https://tesla.evcc.io) will no longer work.
We have considered extending our existing token generation process so that you can use your own Tesla Developer Account.
Fortunately, [myteslamate.com](https://app.myteslamate.com) has already implemented this function.
There you can generate **Access- and Refresh-Tokens** with your Developer Account.
So we decided not to reinvend the wheel.

## What to do?

### For Tesla drivers {#vehicle}

Here is a step-by-step guide to help you set up your Tesla Developer (1) and myteslamate.com (2) account.
We recommend to use two browser windows, since both have to be done somewhat in parallel (see skip hints).

1. Create a **Tesla Fleet API Application**
    1. Log into your [Tesla Developer Portal](https://developer.tesla.com/dashboard) (use your Tesla credentials)
    2. Click **Create New Application** and follow the wizard
    3. Application Details: Pick a name, description and usage you like. (skip to 2.1.)
    4. Client Details: Fill in the three URLs provided by myteslamate.com
    5. API/Scope: Select these scopes
        - profile information
        - vehicle information 
        - vehicle location _(for vehicle detection, not implemented yet)_
        - vehicle commands _(for wakeup)_
        - vehicle charging management _(only for TWC owners, see [instructions below](#charger))_
    6. Billing Details: Can be skipped
    7. You'll receive a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret** (skip to 2.4.)
2. Create a **myteslamate.com account**
    1. Visit [myteslamate.com](https://app.myteslamate.com/)
    2. Select the free **Fleet API & Telemetry** option
    3. Sign in with your Tesla account
    4. Use your personal URLs (Origin, Redirect, Callback) to complete the Tesla Application registration (skip to 1.4.)
    5. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
    6. In the "free and directly" section you will receive your **Access- and Refresh-Tokens**
    7. Copy both tokens to your evcc configuration
    8. Click the **Delete these tokens from MyTeslaMate** button.<br/>
       _This is important and ensures, that evcc is the only application to use these tokens.
       Having multiple applications (including myteslamate.com) use the same tokens will lead to token refresh issues._

Example:

```yaml {5-7}
vehicles:
  - type: template
    template: tesla
    title: Tesla Model 3
    clientId: aaaaaa-11111-...     # von developer.tesla.com
    accessToken: ey1234567890...   # von myteslamate.com
    refreshToken: EU_1234567890... # von myteslamate.com
```

You can also find a [more detailed explanation and guide on myteslamate.com](https://www.myteslamate.com/tesla-api-application-registration/).

You can track your used API credit in the [Overview of the Tesla Developer Portal](https://developer.tesla.com/dashboard/).
    
:::note
The evcc project is in no way connected to myteslamate.com.
We are in contact with [jlestel](https://github.com/jlestel), the developer of myteslamate.com.
The free use of the service for evcc users is explicitly allowed by him.
Please refer to the [Terms of Service](https://www.myteslamate.com/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.myteslamate.com/privacy-policy) before using the service.

### For Tesla Wall Connector users {#charger}

If you use a Tesla Wall Connector, additional steps are required, as the charging commands require signed communication.
myteslamate.com offers a "Command Proxy" for 12 â‚¬ per year, which provides this functionality.

We assume you've already completed the [steps described above](#vehicle).

1. Log into your [myteslamate.com](https://app.myteslamate.com/) account a second time after you've deleted you tokens (see 2.8.)
2. Copy the **Proxy-Token** from the **Use your Tesla API via our proxy** section.
3. Insert the token into your evcc configuration.

```yaml {8}
vehicles:
  - type: template
    template: tesla
    title: Tesla Model 3
    clientId: aaaaaa-11111-...     # von developer.tesla.com
    accessToken: ey1234567890...   # von myteslamate.com
    refreshToken: EU_1234567890... # von myteslamate.com
    proxyToken: aaaaa-bbbbb-...    # von myteslamate.com
```

With this setup, evcc will send charging commands to the myteslamate.com proxy, which will sign it with your Tesla application and forward it to the original Tesla API.

:::warning
The proxy token is very powerful.
It is recommended to limit the permissions at myteslamate.com to the necessary functions.
For evcc, only the functions **Charge Start**, **Charge Stop** and **Set Charging Amps** are necessary.
:::

## Usage data

## tesla.evcc.io will be discontinued

tesla.evcc.io will be discontinued in February.
All tokens generated with it will lose their validity.
For further use of the Tesla API, an update to evcc version 0.133 is required.

## Other alternatives

The Tesla API communication in evcc is not specific to myteslamate.com.
You can generate the tokens with the corresponding infrastructure (public callback URL necessary) yourself and enter them into the evcc configuration mentioned above.

Alternative integrations via services such as [TeslaLogger](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#teslalogger), [TeslaMate](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#teslamate), [TeslaBleHttpProxy](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#tesla-ble), [TeslaMate](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#teslamate), [Tessie](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#tessie) or [Tronity](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#tronity) is also possible.

Tesla Wall Connector owners can also still use [TeslaBleHttpProxy](https://github.com/wimaha/TeslaBleHttpProxy) as a local "Command Proxy".

## Conclusion

We have discussed several alternatives for the Tesla integration.
Special services and price levels for Tesla users were also on the table.
We believe that our current solution from a user's perspective is the best.
On the one hand, it does not cause additional costs for most private users.
The implementation remains sponsor-free.
The API communication does not require third-party services.
Users with larger fleets can also use evcc, where the API usage fees directly accrue at Tesla when the monthly free allowance is exceeded.
