Starting with evcc v0.133, a [Tesla Developer Account](https://developer.tesla.com/) is required.
The usage remains free of charge, but requires an additional setup step.

## Paid Tesla Fleet API starting February

Last year we integrated the [Tesla Fleet API](/blog/2024/02/01/v0.124-new-tesla-api) into evcc.
Tesla was the first manufacturer to provide an official and above all open API for communication with their vehicles.

Tesla had already announced that this API would not stay free of charge.
The prices are now known and will come into effect starting February 1, 2025.
The billing is based on usage, with costs varying depending on the type of request.

With [tesla.evcc.io](https://tesla.evcc.io) we have provided a service that allows evcc users to generate access tokens for API usage.
The API communication of these tokens would be billed to us starting February 2025.
The costs per user depend on the number of vehicles, charging behavior, and the specific configuration of the update interval.
For most users, these costs exceed our "$2 im Monat" sponsoring model and would not be sustainable for us, even if we would require sponsorship for Tesla integration.

## Free API credit for private users

Tesla offers private users a monthly API credit of $10, which should be sufficient for most evcc users.

[![Tesla's API credit](./tesla-credit-en.png)](https://developer.tesla.com/)

With the version 0.133, we have adapted the API communication to Tesla so that you can use your own Tesla Developer Account.
Old tokens generated with [tesla.evcc.io](https://tesla.evcc.io) will no longer work.
We have considered extending our existing token generation process so that you can use your own Tesla Developer Account.
Fortunately, [myteslamate.com](https://app.myteslamate.com) has already implemented this function.
There you can generate **Access- and Refresh-Tokens** with your Developer Account.
So we decided not to reinvend the wheel.

## What to do?

### For Tesla drivers

1. Sign in with your Tesla credentials in the [Tesla Developer Portal](https://developer.tesla.com/)
2. Create a "Fleet API Application" (Company details and billing data can be skipped)
3. You will receive a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**
4. Visit [myteslamate.com](https://app.myteslamate.com/) and select the free "Fleet API & Telemetry" option
5. Sign in with your Tesla account
6. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
7. In the "free and directly" section you will receive your **Access- and Refresh-Tokens**
8. Enter these values in your evcc configuration

Example:

```yaml {5-7}
vehicles:
  - type: template
    template: tesla
    title: Tesla Model 3
    clientId: aaaaaa-11111-...     # von developer.tesla.com
    accessToken: ey1234567890...   # von myteslamate.com
    refreshToken: EU_1234567890... # von myteslamate.com
```

On myteslamate.com you will find a [more detailed explanation and guide](https://www.myteslamate.com/tesla-api-application-registration/).

For the evcc use case, only the Tesla permissions "Profile information", "Vehicle data" and "Vehicle location" are required.

You can track your used API credit in the [Overview of the Tesla Developer Portal](https://developer.tesla.com/dashboard/).
    
:::note
The evcc project is in no way connected to myteslamate.com.
We are in contact with [jlestel](https://github.com/jlestel), the developer of myteslamate.com.
The free use of the service for evcc users is explicitly allowed by him.
Please refer to the [Terms of Service](https://www.myteslamate.com/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.myteslamate.com/privacy-policy) before using the service.

### For Tesla Wall Connector users

If you use a Tesla Wall Connector, additional steps are required, as the charging commands require signed communication.
myteslamate.com offers a "Command Proxy" for 12 â‚¬ per year, which provides this functionality.
After registration you will receive a **Proxy-Token**, which you must enter in your evcc configuration.

```yaml {8}
vehicles:
  - type: template
    template: tesla
    title: Tesla Model 3
    clientId: aaaaaa-11111-...     # von developer.tesla.com
    accessToken: ey1234567890...   # von myteslamate.com
    refreshToken: EU_1234567890... # von myteslamate.com
    proxyToken: aaaaa-bbbbb-...    # von myteslamate.com
```

In addition to the permissions mentioned above, the "Vehicle charging management" permission is also required for this function.

:::warning
The proxy token is very powerful.
It is recommended to limit the permissions at myteslamate.com to the necessary functions.
For evcc, only the functions **Charge Start**, **Charge Stop** and **Set Charging Amps** are necessary.
:::

## Usage data

## tesla.evcc.io will be discontinued

tesla.evcc.io will be discontinued in February.
All tokens generated with it will lose their validity.
For further use of the Tesla API, an update to evcc version 0.133 is required.

## Other alternatives

The Tesla API communication in evcc is not specific to myteslamate.com.
You can generate the tokens with the corresponding infrastructure (public callback URL necessary) yourself and enter them into the evcc configuration mentioned above.

Alternative integrations via services such as [TeslaLogger](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#teslalogger), [TeslaMate](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#teslamate), [TeslaBleHttpProxy](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#tesla-ble), [TeslaMate](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#teslamate), [Tessie](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#tessie) or [Tronity](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/vehicles#tronity) is also possible.

Tesla Wall Connector owners can also still use [TeslaBleHttpProxy](https://github.com/wimaha/TeslaBleHttpProxy) as a local "Command Proxy".

## Conclusion

We have discussed several alternatives for the Tesla integration.
Special services and price levels for Tesla users were also on the table.
We believe that our current solution from a user's perspective is the best.
On the one hand, it does not cause additional costs for most private users.
The implementation remains sponsor-free.
The API communication does not require third-party services.
Users with larger fleets can also use evcc, where the API usage fees directly accrue at Tesla when the monthly free allowance is exceeded.
