**Osnabrücker Ruderverein e.V.**<br />
Glückaufstraße 16<br />

The rowing club is located directly at the Stichkanal and offers a great atmosphere for our meetup.
As you can read in the [community portrait](/blog/2025/11/29/osnabruecker-ruderverein), the club uses evcc for its own energy management.

We're incredibly excited to finally see some faces behind the GitHub usernames!
Whether you're a user or developer, whether you've been around for a while or just started with evcc: come along!

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out in the [GitHub Discussions thread](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/25787).

**See you in April in Osnabrück!**<br />
