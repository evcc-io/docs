The [evcc App](/docs/features/app) is now also available on F-Droid.
F-Droid is an alternative Android app store that only provides free software without proprietary dependencies.

In addition to the Google Play Store, Android users could alternatively download the evcc App as [APK from GitHub](https://github.com/evcc-io/app/releases/latest).
Now it is also available on F-Droid.
You can use it independently of Google account and Google infrastructure and update it conveniently.

The evcc App is Open Source and contains no tracking.
With the distribution via F-Droid, the potential tracking of the traditional app store operators also disappears.

To ensure that the App you install contains only what you see in the GitHub repository, F-Droid offers the possibility to **build reproducibly**.
This required some adjustments to our Expo-based build process.
Thank you [Maschga](https://github.com/Maschga) and [linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) for the help!

The new version 1.0.3 contains smaller bug fixes and improvements for iOS users.
All details can be found in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/evcc-io/app/releases/tag/1.0.3).
