The [SmartHütte Podcast](https://podcast.smarthuette.de/) is a technical, nerdy podcast about smart home, self-hosting and other tech topics.
Hosts [Andrej Friesen](https://techhub.social/@ajfriesen) and [Thomas Wiebe](https://mas.to/@behweh) regularly discuss their experiences with Home Assistant, Kubernetes, hosting and everything else that interests them.

I was a guest on the latest episode and talked about the evcc project.

## What's it about?

In the over two-hour episode, we discuss the origins of evcc and solar surplus charging.
We talk about wallboxes and how smart they really are – and what problems arise when manufacturers want to make them too smart.
We talk about the challenges of vehicle integration, cloud dependencies and the EU Data Act.
We discuss the sponsoring model, the journey from YAML configuration to graphical interface and how evcc and Home Assistant complement each other – from integration via MQTT to using Home Assistant entities as evcc devices and vice versa.
Also: forecasts, optimizer, AI-generated pull requests and the question of when you should really control your coffee machine with solar surplus.
