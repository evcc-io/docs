# evcc docs

Official documentation repository of [evcc](https://evcc.io).

## General

- The source content of the folder `templates` is the `templates/definition` folder in the [evcc repository](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc)
- We recommend to test changes locally, use the instructions below to run the documentation page locally as you can see how the changes will look like on the web page while you make changes.
- English translation: If possible please provide the translation in English as well to ensure that the content does not get out of sync.

## Local setup

First clone the repository, then follow with the following steps.

**Requirement:** You need to have [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version >= 22) and `npm` installed (comes with `nodejs`).

### Installation

```sh
$ npm ci
```

### Local Development

```sh
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

Start in English mode.

```sh
npm run start -- --locale en
```

### Build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. It should be run before any changes are committed, as it also includes link checking.

### Update CLI docs

CLI documentation is automatically generated.
Generation needs to be triggered manually.
Run this command inside the evcc core repository (e.g. `./evcc`).

```sh
go run main.go gendoc ../evcc-docs/docs/reference/cli/
```
