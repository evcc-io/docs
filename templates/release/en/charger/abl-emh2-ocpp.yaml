      stationid: EVB-P12354 # Station ID, Station ID of the charging point. Only required if multiple OCPP charging stations are set up to assign them correctly. A single OCPP charging station can also be automatically assigned. Note: In exceptional cases, it may be necessary to manually append this ID to the OCPP URL of the charging station in the form `ws://<evcc-address>:8887/<stationid>`. Most charging stations automatically add the ID internally. (optional)

      connector: 1 # Connector number, For charging stations with multiple connectors. Counting starts at 1 for the first connector. (optional)
      remotestart: # Start remote transaction on vehicle connection, Only enable this option if there is no way to initiate transactions from the charger side! This is only the case if e.g. no RFID reader is available and charging processes would have to be released individually via app. Normally, the charger should always be configured at the device so that either an RFID card is used for activation or the charger is set to "Autostart", "Free Charging" or similar. First check the documentation and configuration possibilities of the charger, ask the manufacturer if necessary! (Uses OCPP RemoteStartTransaction) (optional)
      idtag: evcc # Authentication token, This option is only required in exceptional cases if the charger requires a specific token for accepting external transactions. (Uses OCPP RemoteStartTransaction) (optional)
      connecttimeout: 5m # Timeout for registration, Timeout for the registration of the charging point (optional)
      meterinterval: 10s # Transmission interval for meter values, Time interval for transmission of meter values (MeterValueSampleInterval) (optional)
      metervalues: Energy.Active.Import.Register,Power.Active.Import,SoC,Current.Offered,Power.Offered,Current.Import,Voltage # Meter values for transmission, Manual specification of the meter values to be configured (MeterValuesSampledData) (optional)
