  Tesla offers an official, but paid vehicle API.
  For private use, you can create a [Tesla Developer Account](https://developer.tesla.com/) and receive a monthly API credit of $10.
  This is usually sufficient for the common evcc use cases.

  The [myteslamate.com](https://www.myteslamate.com/tesla-api-application-registration/) guide explains the process and generates a free Access and Refresh Token.
  With this token pair and your Client ID created in the Tesla Developer Account, evcc can directly communicate with the Tesla API.
  You can see your used credit in the Tesla Developer Dashboard.

  To use a Tesla Wall Connector, you need a public Command Proxy Server.
  [myteslamate.com](https://app.myteslamate.com/) provides such a service with per-use pricing.
  Configure the Command permissions at myteslamate.com and enter the Proxy Token here.
  Start, stopp and current commands are sent to Tesla via this proxy.

  More information and alternatives can be found in [our blog post](https://docs.evcc.io/en/blog/2025/01/20/tesla-api-update).
