  Tesla `access` and `refresh` tokens are required. These can be generated through [tesla.evcc.io](https://tesla.evcc.io).
  Controlling vehicles in conjunction with a Tesla Wall Connector is done via an evcc proxy server and requires a sponsor token. The evcc virtual key must be installed on the vehicle.
  See [tesla.evcc.io](https://tesla.evcc.io).

      commandProxy: https://tesla.evcc.io/ # When using a TWC3 (or other 'dumb' charger not capable of control), evcc can manage the charge directly by communicating with the vehicle through a Command Proxy. By default, the proxy provided by evcc is used. With this parameter, you set the base URL of a custom Command Proxy to use instead of the default evcc one. See for example https://github.com/wimaha/TeslaBleHttpProxy for a proxy sending commands via bluetooth. (optional)
