  Only supported if the vehicle can provide the state of charge (Soc) to the connected charger.
  Using ISO15118 with some VW group vehicles, e.g. Porsche Taycan, requires additional configuration in the vehicle.
  This requires an active location-based charging profile with the lowest minimum charge (25%) and direct charging disabled.
  Otherwise the vehicle cannot be put into sleep mode.
