  description: OCPP 1.6J compatible charger with Smart Charging Profile
  group: Generic support
description: |
  With OCPP the connection will be established from charger (client) to evcc (server).
  The charger needs to be able to reach evcc via the host name (functioning DNS resolution required!) or via the IP address on port 8887.
  By default, the first incoming connection with any station identifier is used.
  In order to be able to clearly assign several charging points, the respective station identifier (`stationid: `) and connector number (`connector: `) must be configured.
  Many wallboxes automatically add the `station id` to the backend URL, some have to do this manually `ws://<evcc>:8887/<stationid>`.
  The charger may need a pre-configured (virtual) token ID/RFID identifier (`idtag: `) with which the charging sessions can be started without authorization.
  If the charger supports sending metering values try to adjust the interval to a short time span.

  Requirements:
  * If necessary, remove previously configured OCPP profiles (e.g. used for a different backend connection) in the charger configuration
  * Backend URL (Central System) in the charger configuration: `ws://[evcc-adresse]:8887/` (possibly add `stationid`)
  * Protocol: OCPP-J v1.6, ocpp16j, JSON, Websocket, ws:// or similar
  * No encryption, no authentication, no password
  * Local network connection
