description: |
  A charger implementation that delegates control to the vehicle instead of controlling the charger directly.
  This is useful for "granny chargers" or simple chargers that cannot be controlled.

  The charger requires a vehicle that supports charge control (start/stop charging) and the ability to report the charging status.
  If the vehicle supports position tracking, this can be used for geofencing.
  When geofencing is enabled, the evcc will only affect charging behavior when the vehicle is within the specified radius of the home coordinates.
