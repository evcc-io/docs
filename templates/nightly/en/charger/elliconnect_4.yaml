  The device has to have a fix IP address (manuall or via DHCP).

  The identification of a vehicle using the RFID card is not possible.

  Important: A mostly flawless functionality can only be provided with an external energy meter and no usage of CT coils, due to sosftware bugs of the Wallbox. Using a LAN connection is highly recommended.

  Note: If you've added an energy meter to your charger please use the Pro or Connected+ integration.
