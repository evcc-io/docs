  Chargers connected through Plugchoice can leverage its OCPP proxy functionality to establish a connection to other backoffices while maintaining full control through EVCC. This allows seamless management of Plugchoice-registered chargers directly from EVCC.

  For improved meter readings, it is recommended to configure the following settings in the Plugchoice portal under the configuration tab:

  - Set `MeterValueSampleInterval` to 10 seconds (or another interval according to your preference).
  - Set `MeterValuesSampledData` to `Energy.Active.Import.Register,Current.Offered,Current.Import,Voltage`.

  These adjustments enable more frequent and detailed reporting of charging data to EVCC.
