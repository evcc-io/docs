  To use with EVCC, you need a Volvo account and a Volvo Connected Car API Key.
  To do this, create a new application on the [Account page](https://developer.volvocars.com/account/) and save the primary VCC API key.
  Now publish your application and select the permissions "Connected Vehicle API -> conve:vehicle-relation" and "Energy API -> (everything)" under "Scopes".
  You must enter the URL of your EVCC instance as the redirect URL, e.g. "http://evcc.local:7070/oauth/callback".
  Once the application is created, it will be displayed as "Publication under Review". This is not a problem, it still works.
  When adding the vehicle via the UI, an error message is displayed.
  Check the log for the message "registering oauth provider at /oauth/login?..." and open the link "http://evcc.local:7070/oauth/login?..." in a new tab.
  Log in with your Volvo account and allow access to the data. If the authorization is successful, the vehicle can be added.
