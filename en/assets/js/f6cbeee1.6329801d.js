Change the template name from `tesla` to `tesla-command` to use the new API.\\n\\n2. **Generate new tokens:** With the new API it is now possible to generate the required `accessToken` and `refreshToken` directly in the browser.\\nFor this we have provided a small website at [tesla.evcc.io](https://tesla.evcc.io).\\n\\nThe configuration should then look like this:\\n\\n```yaml\\nvehicles:\\n - name: mytesla\\n   type: template\\n   template: tesla-command # change `tesla` to `tesla-command`\\n   accessToken: ... # generetad by tesla.evcc.io\\n   refreshToken:  ... # generetad by tesla.evcc.io\\n   ...\\n```\\n\\nThe tokens generated via [tesla.evcc.io](https://tesla.evcc.io) can **only be used with the official evcc builds** (stable & nightly).\\nThe reason for this is that the tokens from Tesla\'s new Developer API are always bound to a 3rd-party app.\\n\\nYou can of course still build evcc yourself.\\nHowever, you will need your own Tesla Developer Account and have to generate the tokens yourself.\\nMore details can be found in the corresponding [Pull Request](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/pull/10802).\\n\\n### Privacy & Security\\n\\nAs with the old API, the communication for data retrieval (charge level, status, ...) and control (wake up) runs directly between your local evcc instance and the Tesla infrastructure.\\nOnly the token generation runs once via our website.\\nTokens are not stored, but only displayed to you in the browser.\\n\\nFor an extended control of the vehicle (start and stop charging directly at the vehicle) an additional signed request to Tesla is required.\\nToday this affects the users of a Tesla Wall Connector.\\nSince we cannot and may not pack our private 3rd party app key into the evcc binary, we will probably provide our [own service](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/pull/11893) for this application, which signs these requests and forwards them to Tesla.\\nBut more on that in a later release.\\n\\n### Costs\\n\\nTesla is currently offering the new API [free of charge](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api#membership-tiers).\\nHowever, they have already announced that they will charge fees for using the API in the future.\\nUnfortunately, we do not yet know how open source friendly this model will be.\\n\\nIt\'s quite possible that we won\'t be able to offer token generation for free in the future.\\nWe may link it to the existing evcc sponsorship model.\\nBut more on that when there is new information from Tesla.\\n\\n## Active Battery Control\\n\\nA big new feature that comes with the Christmas release is the active battery control.\\nThis function is no longer marked as experimental.\\nIn addition, some new supported battery inverters have been added in recent weeks.\\nIn the documentation you can now see [if your inverter is supported](/docs/devices/meters#features).\\n\\n### Passive Control\\n\\nPassive battery control has been available in evcc for some time now.\\nHere evcc regulates the solar charging so that the house battery is not discharged unintentionally.\\nLast year we introduced a [configuration dialog](/blog/2023/10/05/feature-highlights-10-2023#battery-settings) where you can set the priority between vehicle and house battery charging.\\nThis model works very well for solar charging.\\nevcc knows the current state of charge of the house battery and only regulates the charging power of the vehicle.\\nHowever, this mechanism does not work for fast charging.\\nAn active battery control is required for this.\\n\\n### Prevent discharge during fast charging\\n\\nBy default, the house battery tries to cover the entire energy consumption of the house (including charging stations).\\nDepending on the current electricity price or expected PV generation, however, it may be desirable to obtain the energy for **fast vehicle charging** directly from the grid and not from the house battery.\\nThis way the collected solar energy remains in the house battery and can be used for the house consumption at night, for example.\\n\\nThis is our first use case for active battery control.\\nIf your inverter supports this feature, a corresponding option will appear in the battery settings dialog.\\n\\n![Battery control: Prevent battery discharge when fast charging](batterycontrol-en.webp)\\n\\nWhen this option is active, the house battery is put into a lock mode during fast charging.\\nIn this time it is neither discharged nor charged.\\nThis lock is also active during [scheduled charging](/blog/2023/10/05/feature-highlights-10-2023#visualisierung-ladeplanung) and [smart grid charging](/blog/2023/10/05/feature-highlights-10-2023#smartes-netzladen).\\n\\n### Next step: Charging the battery with cheap grid power\\n\\nThe next stage of development for active battery control is the possibility to charge the house battery with cheap grid power.\\nThis is especially interesting for users of dynamic electricity tariffs on darker days.\\nThe goal here is to fill the house battery with energy from the grid during low price phases and then use this energy in-house during high price phases.\\nWe have already implemented the necessary hardware integrations.\\nTherefore we expect this feature to be available in one of the next releases.\\n\\n## Update: Migration to browser configuration\\n\\nevcc is a very flexible and powerful system for your own energy optimization.\\nOur biggest challenge is still to combine this flexibility with an easy setup process.\\nIn the last months we have made great progress in the area of configuration.\\nOur goal is to enable a pure browser-based commissioning, without `evcc.yaml`.\\n\\nIf you have activated the option \\"Show experimental UI features\\" in the settings dialog, you can see our current development progress under \\"\ud83e\uddea Device Configuration\\".\\nCurrently you can add and edit vehicles, grid meters, PV and battery systems there.\\nCharging stations and tariffs will follow in the next iteration.\\nEven though this is still a \\"work in progress\\", we look forward to your feedback.\\n\\n![Device configuration](config-ui.webp)\\n\\n## Small improvements and bug fixes\\n\\nAs always, this release also contains a number of smaller improvements and bug fixes.\\nFor more details, have a look at the [Release Notes](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/releases/tag/0.124.0).\\n\\nAll the best<br/>\\nyour evcc core

We have added many new features and fixed some bugs. In this article we will highlight some of the new features.\\n\\n## Charging planner visualization\\n\\nThe charging planner has been around for a while at evcc.\\nYou specify when your vehicle should have a desired state of charge and evcc finds the best time slots.\\nSince a few releases the algorithm is no longer a black box, as we visualize the planning result.\\n\\n<Video src={chargingplanVideo} poster={chargingplanPoster} />\\n\\nHow does the algorithm work?\\n\\n5. Surplus solar energy is prioritized\\n6. Times with cheap grid electricity (if [dynamic electricity tariff](/docs/reference/configuration/tariffs/#type-awattar) exists)\\n7. Times with clean grid electricity (if [CO\u2082 interface](/docs/reference/configuration/tariffs/#co2) is configured)\\n8. Time windows shortly before departure\\n\\n**Outlook:** We are currently experimenting with PV forecast data from [Solcast](https://solcast.com/).\\nThis allows the algorithm to make even better decisions.\\nFor example, if the charging target is during the day, it may make sense not to charge the vehicle completely with cheap night-time electricity, but to leave room for surplus energy during the day.\\n\\n## UI adjustable minimum charge\\n\\nThe minimum charge function has been around at evcc for ages.\\nIt is helpful if you come home with only a few percent and want to make sure you always have enough range for an unexpected event.\\n\\nUntil now, it could only be set via the configuration file or via API.\\nNow you can also do this via the UI under **Plan** > **Arrival** > **Min. charge %**.\\n\\nThe settings are stored per vehicle and are retained even after a restart or update.\\n\\n<Video src={minsocVideo} poster={minsocPoster} />\\n\\n## Smart grid charging\\n\\nWhen your own PV surplus is not enough, you can also use grid electricity when it is particularly cheap or clean.\\nIf you click on the grid electricity price or CO\u2082 emissions in the energy flow diagram, the **Smart Grid Charging** dialog opens.\\n\\nThere you can set a threshold for the price or CO\u2082 emissions.\\nIf this value is exceeded, evcc temporarily all PV mode loadpoints to fast charging.\\n\\n<Video src={dynamicpricesVideo} poster={dynamicpricesPoster} />\\n\\nPrerequisite for this function is that you have configured either a dynamic electricity price or a CO\u2082 integration.\\n\\nAnother small enhancement is that with most dynamic electricity prices you now have the option to correct the price values from the API with **percentage or fixed charges** (`charges` / `tax`).\\nTibber and Octopus Energy (UK) already provide values including charges.\\nWith Awattar, Nordpool Estonia and Energinet you can now add these.\\n\\nBy the way: If you have a dynamic electricity tariff that is not yet supported, but offers an API, please open a GitHub issue.\\n\\n## Battery settings\\n\\nA huge advantage that evcc has over other surplus charging solutions is the integration with the home battery.\\nThe configuration value [`prioritySoc`](/docs/reference/configuration/site/#prioritysoc) can be used to control whether surplus solar energy should be **charged into the home battery or the vehicle** first.\\n\\nIn general, evcc tries to prevent the home battery from being unloaded into the vehicle battery in PV mode in order to avoid unnecessary conversion losses.\\nHowever, with the value [`bufferSoc`](/docs/reference/configuration/site/#buffersoc) you can consciously **dedicate a portion of the home battery to support charging**.\\n\\nYou can also set the charging process to start automatically as soon as the battery has reached a certain state of charge ([`bufferStartSoc`](/docs/reference/configuration/site/#bufferstartsoc)).\\nThe automatic charging starts even if the sun is not shining.\\n\\n<Video src={batterysettingsVideo} poster={batterysettingsPoster} />\\n\\n## Solar %, price, CO\u2082 per charging session\\n\\nWe also have something for the friends of data analysis.\\nWe now record the share of own solar energy (in %), the price (total and per kWh), the charging time and the average CO\u2082 emissions per charging session.\\nYou can switch between these values directly at the charging session.\\n\\n<Video src={sessionvaluesVideo} poster={sessionvaluesPoster} />\\n\\n## New calculation of solar share\\n\\nIf you have noticed that the share of solar energy has decreased slightly since one of the last versions, this is due to our new calculation.\\nUntil now, evcc has always distributed the ratio of grid and own energy evenly between house consumption and charging sessions.\\n\\nWe have now switched to a new model in which the house consumption first gets the green electricity and the remaining mix goes to the charging sessions.\\nThanks to [@MarkusGH](https://github.com/MarkusGH) for the implementation.\\nYou can find more details about the model [in the documentation](/docs/guides/setup/#savings-calculation).\\n\\n![New calculation](./calculation.webp)\\n\\n## Charging sessions overview\\n\\nThe new values have of course also found their way into the overview of the charging sessions.\\nDepending on the configuration, prices and CO\u2082 emissions can now also be seen here.\\nIn addition, we have completely redesigned the display and chosen a **compact table display on a monthly basis**.\\nIt can be **filtered by charging point and vehicle**.\\n\\nIf you need even more flexibility here, you can of course also use the CSV export or get the raw data directly via InfluxDB or MQTT.\\n\\n<Video src={chargingsessionsVideo} poster={chargingsessionsPoster} />\\n\\n## Prioritization of charging points and vehicles\\n\\nIf you have multiple charging points, you can use the [`priority`](/docs/reference/configuration/loadpoints/#priority) setting to specify which one should be preferred.\\nYou can also make the prioritization dependent on the detected vehicle or control it via API.\\nThere is currently no configuration via the UI.\\n\\nThe prioritization function is also helpful if you use evcc to control other consumers, for example [a heating rod or heat pump connected via the plugin interface](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/pull/9393).\\nThis way you can control them so that they only run when the car is not charging (enough).\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nOur [backlog](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abacklog) is well filled.\\nThese are the next big topics we want to tackle:\\n\\n**Config UI:** All prerequisites are now met.\\nCurrently, vehicles can already be created in \ud83e\uddea experimental mode and the jump to network, PV or battery configuration is not far away.\\nThere is still a lot to do here, but the light at the end of the tunnel is visible.\\n\\n**Better planning:** As mentioned above, we are working on integrating good **PV forecasts** into the planning algorithm and the UI.\\nWe also have a concept for supporting **multiple charging plans**.\\n\\n**Mode revision:** evcc started as an application for PV surplus charging.\\nIn the meantime, the interaction with the home battery is also playing a major role.\\nThe topic of **grid-friendly charging** based on dynamic electricity tariffs or CO\u2082 emissions is also gaining momentum.\\nTherefore, we will revise our charging modes (currently PV and Min+PV) and create more flexibility here.\\n\\n## Further new features\\n\\nThis was a flyover at high level and from an end user perspective.\\nOf course, there is also a lot of work going on under the hood.\\n\\n- \ud83d\udd0c Support for additional chargers from 22 new manufacturers\\n- \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udd0b\ud83d\udcdf Support for meter, PV and battery systems from 36 new manufacturers\\n- \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Website and documentation in English

Damit kannst du eine Zielzeit definieren zu der das verbundene Fahrzeug einen bestimmten Ladestand erreichen soll. Die Funktion ist bspw. praktisch um den Wagen vor l\xe4ngeren Fahrten p\xfcnktlich zur Abfahrt aufzuladen.\\n\\n![Zielladen](zielladen.webp)\\n\\nDie bisherige Ladestrategie war relativ simpel: Die Ladung wird m\xf6glichst sp\xe4t gestartet, sodass der Akku p\xfcnktlich zur Abfahrt den gew\xfcnschten Stand erreicht hat. Das schont den Akku da er nicht lange auf hohen Ladest\xe4nden geparkt wird.\\n\\nMit diesem Release wird der Ladeplaner intelligenter und bezieht dynamische Energiepreise und CO\u2082-Daten mit ein. Damit wird die Ladung auf Zeitfenster geplant in denen besonders viel erneuerbarer Strom im Netz ist. Das spart Geld, entlastet das Stromnetz und reduziert den Bedarf an fossilien Energietr\xe4gern.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcc8 B\xf6rsenpreise mit awattar und Tibber\\n\\nDie stundenabh\xe4ngigen Tarife von awattar und Tibber haben wir schon l\xe4nger angebunden. Bislang hatten wir aber nur eine einfache Steuerung, die das Laden unter einem vorher zu konfigurierenden Strompreis freigibt (`cheap`).\\n\\nJetzt werden die st\xfcndlichen Preise auch in der Ladeplanung verwendet und das Auto l\xe4dt dann wenn der Netzstrom besonders g\xfcnstig ist.\\n\\nKonfiguration f\xfcr awattar\\n\\n```yaml\\ntariffs:\\n  grid:\\n    type: awattar\\n    region: de # or at\\n```\\n\\nKonfiguration f\xfcr Tibber\\n\\n```yaml\\ntariffs:\\n  grid:\\n    type: tibber\\n    token: \\"476...963a4\\" # access token\\n```\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcca Manuelle Zeittarife\\n\\nEs ist nun auch m\xf6glich Zeittarife zu hinterlegen.

Daf\xfcr binden wir jetzt CO\u2082-Daten ein. Aktuell haben wir zwei Quellen implementiert. Wir sind aber offen f\xfcr weitere Vorschl\xe4ge.\\n\\n[Gr\xfcnStromIndex](https://gruenstromindex.de) liefert regionale Vorhersagen \xfcber die Sauberkeit des Netzstroms f\xfcr Deutschland. Du musst lediglich deine Postleitzahl hinterlegen.\\n\\n```yaml\\nplanner:\\n  type: gr\xfcnstromindex\\n  zip: 12349\\n```\\n\\n[Electricity Map](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map) liefert weltweite Vorhersagen. F\xfcr die Nutzung in evcc ben\xf6tigt Ihr ein Token und den URL Pr\xe4fix. Diese Daten bekommst du mit dem [kostenlosen Account im API portal](https://api-portal.electricitymaps.com/).\\n\\n```yaml\\nplanner:\\n  type: electricitymaps\\n  uri: https://api-access.electricitymaps.com/2w...1g/\\n  token: Rp...D2\\n  zone: DE\\n```\\n\\n## Ausblick\\n\\nF\xfcr eines der n\xe4chsten Releases arbeiten wir an einer visuellen Aufbereitung des Ladeplans.

Inzwischen macht evcc aber nicht nur unser privates Sonnenladen leichter. Es gibt vermutlich mehrere tausend Installationen, die morgens das Auto wecken, sobald die Sonne auf die heimische PV-Anlage scheint. Der Gedanke macht uns sehr froh.\\n\\nGenaue Zahlen \xfcber unsere Nutzerbasis haben wir nicht. Wir m\xf6gen Datensparsamkeit und haben daher auch keine Ambition ein allgemeines Tracking in unsere Webseite oder die Applikation einzubauen. Dennoch k\xf6nnen wir anhand von Zahlen aus Docker (bisher >1 Mio. Pulls) und Cloudsmith (aktuell ~4.5k Paketdownloads pro Tag) ziemlich gut erkennen, dass sich Viele im Alltag auf evcc verlassen.\\n\\nDamit wir das Projekt mit ausreichendem Fokus pflegen und weiterentwickeln k\xf6nnen, ist nachhaltige Finanzierung ein wichtiges Thema. Hinter evcc steckt kein gro\xdfes Unternehmen, kein Wallboxhersteller und wir haben auch keine Lust auf das Startupspiel mit Investoren. Aktuell ist evcc ein Projekt, was wir in unserer Freizeit vorantreiben. Wir sind \xfcberzeugt davon, dass es eine gute Idee ist, direkt f\xfcr euch, die Nutzer zu arbeiten und unabh\xe4ngig von anderen Verpflichtungen und Zw\xe4ngen zu sein.\\n\\nMit **GitHub\'s Sponsoring** haben wir eine sehr leichtgewichtige und einfache L\xf6sung gefunden, um finanzielle Unterst\xfctzung direkt von Nutzern entgegennehmen zu k\xf6nnen. Zudem haben wir dadurch die M\xf6glichkeit, **einige Funktionen exklusiv f\xfcr Sponsoren** bereitzustellen. Momentan sind dies bestimmte Wallbox-Typen und die Telemetry Funktion, wir k\xf6nnen uns aber durchaus vorstellen dieses Modell in Zukunft noch anzupassen.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc9a Danke an alle Sponsoren\\n\\nAktuell haben wir **\xfcber 1.500 Sponsoren** \ud83e\udd73, die einen monatlichen Beitrag von mindestens $2 zahlen. Das ist ziemlich cool, ein gro\xdfer Vertrauensbeweis und best\xe4rkt uns darin weiter viel Zeit in das Projekt zu investieren.\\n\\nZus\xe4tzlich zum Sponsortoken um Funktionen freizuschalten schicken wir allen Unterst\xfctzern auch gerne Sticker. Damit k\xf6nnt ihr Laptop, Raspberry, Wallbox oder euer Ladeequipment versch\xf6nern. Den Link zum Stickerformular findet ihr in der evcc UI unten rechts beim Klick auf das Sonnensymbol.\\n\\n| [@evcc_io](https://twitter.com/evcc_io/status/1489667714411114502)                                                    | [@Ein_Klimawender](https://twitter.com/Ein_Klimawender/status/1589844295992819712)                                        | [@frd9900](https://twitter.com/frd9900/status/1591416016848162816)                                                      |\\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| [![Tweet @evcc_io](sticker_evcc.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/evcc_io/status/1489667714411114502)                        | [![Tweet @Ein_Klimawender](sticker_Ein_Klimawender.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/Ein_Klimawender/status/1589844295992819712) | [![Tweet @frd9900](sticker_frd9900.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/frd9900/status/1591416016848162816)                       |\\n| [@ABBolle](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/4446#discussioncomment-4069333)                                | [@rediculum](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/4446#discussion-4393578)                                         | [@123aerox](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/4446#discussioncomment-4013806)                                 |\\n| [![GitHub @ABBolle](sticker_ABBolle.jpg)](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/4446#discussioncomment-4069333) | [![GitHub @rediculum](sticker_rediculum.png)](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/4446#discussion-4393578)        | [![GitHub @123aerox](sticker_123aerox.jpg)](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/4446#discussioncomment-4013806) |\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcee Einmal-Sponsoring\\n\\nWir haben schon mehrfach das Feedback bekommen, dass Nutzer Bauchschmerzen mit monatlichen Zahlungen haben und sich eine M\xf6glichkeit der Einmalzahlung w\xfcnschen, um ein Sponsortoken zu erhalten. Dies ist nun m\xf6glich. Auf der [GitHub Sponsoring Seite](https://github.com/sponsors/evcc-io?frequency=one-time) gibt es jetzt neben den monatlichen auch One-time-Stufen. Folgende Preisstufen haben wir uns \xfcberlegt:\\n\\n- **\ud83c\udf31 $100 - Nachhaltige Entwicklung**<br />Du tr\xe4gst dazu bei, dass wir auch zuk\xfcnftig viel Energie in die Weiterentwicklung von evcc investieren k\xf6nnen. Au\xdferdem bekommst du **ein unbefristetes Sponsortoken**, mit dem du alle evcc Funktionen nutzen kannst.\\n- **\u2600\ufe0f $150 - Friends & Family**<br />Du bekommst **drei unbefristete Sponsortoken**. Eins f\xfcr dich und zwei weitere, die du an Freunde oder Familie weitergeben kannst. Du wirst als Sponsor auf [evcc.io](https://evcc.io) erw\xe4hnt.\\n- **\ud83d\ude9b $1.000 - Multiplikator**<br />F\xfcr Elektriker und Solarteure. Du bekommst **zehn unbefristete Sponsortoken**, die du f\xfcr deine Kundenprojekte einsetzen kannst.\\n\\nDie Ausstellung f\xfcr die unbefristeten Sponsortoken funktioniert genauso wie der aktuelle Prozess \xfcber [sponsor.evcc.io](https://sponsor.evcc.io). Einziger Unterschied ist, dass das Token nicht abl\xe4uft.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f Contributor-Token\\n\\nCommunity-Mitglieder, die \xfcber GitHub PRs zu substanziell zu evcc beigetragen haben, k\xf6nnen auch ein freies Token erhalten. Wir sind immer froh \xfcber Bugfixes, brauchen aber auch dringend Unterst\xfctzung im Bereich Dokumentation und [\xdcbersetzung](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/5218).\\n\\nWas genau eine substantielle Contribution ist, haben wir nicht klar geregelt. Einen Kommafehler rausmachen qualifiziert noch nicht, das Beheben eines fiesen Bugs reicht aber definitiv. Schreib uns einfach eine Mail an [info@evcc.io](mailto:info@evcc.io) mit Verweis auf deinen GitHub Nutzernamen.\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude9a GitHub Sponsoring zieht um\\n\\nAktuell l\xe4uft das GitHub Sponsoring \xfcber den Account von [@andig](https://github.com/andig), dem Gr\xfcnder von evcc. Der Betrag, der nach Ausgaben (Infrastruktur, Sticker, ...) im Monat \xfcbrig bleibt, wird \xfcber einen Verteilungsschl\xfcssel an alle drei Mitglieder vom Core-Team verteilt. Um diesen Prozess transparenter zu machen, ziehen wir unser GitHub Sponsoring jetzt auf die [evcc-io Organisation](https://github.com/sponsors/evcc-io) um. Wenn ihr bereits Sponsor seid, m\xfcsst ihr nichts ver\xe4ndern. Euer Token l\xe4uft wie gewohnt weiter und auch der Beitrag findet den Weg an alle Teammitglieder. Wir haben aber alle Links zum Sponsoring auf die Organisation umgestellt. Einmalzahlungen gibt es auch nur dort.\\n\\n[![Migration GitHub Sponsoring](migrate-sponsoring.png)](https://github.com/sponsors/evcc-io)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc33 Docker Image zieht um\\n\\nIm gleichen Zug ziehen wir auch unsere Docker Images um. Bislang wurden die Pakete unter `andig/evcc` ver\xf6ffentlicht. Nun findet ihr die offiziellen Versionen unter `evcc/evcc`.\\n\\nAn dieser Stelle noch einmal Danke an das Docker Team, die evcc als [Docker-Sponsored Open-Source-Projekt](https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/application/) qualifiziert haben.

Since evcc now also supports the very popular [Bender Controller](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/pull/3103) we were able to significantly expand the portfolie of supported devices.\\n\\nHere are the manufacturers that have been added since the beginning of the year: Alphatec, Ebee, Ensto, Garo, HardyBarth, Innogy, Juice, Mennekes, OpenWB Pro, Optec, PC Electric, SmartWB, TechniSat, Tapo Smarthome, Ubitricity Vestel, Webasto. [(All charging stations)](/docs/devices/chargers)\\n\\n### Vehicles \ud83d\ude97 \ud83d\udef5\\n\\nAudi (e-tron), Cupra, Jaguar, Landrover, Mercedes, Silence S01, Smart. [(All vehicles)](/docs/devices/vehicles)\\n\\n### Inverters \u2600\ufe0f \ud83d\udd0b\\n\\nSMA (Data Manager M Lite), Shelly (1PM, 3EM), Siemens (PAC 2200), OpenEMS, TQ. [(All meters)](/docs/devices/meters)\\n\\n### Grid meters \ud83d\udcdf\\n\\nSMA (Data Manager M Lite), Shelly (1PM, 3EM), Siemens (PAC 2200), OpenEMS, TQ. [(All meters)](/docs/devices/meters)\\n\\n### RFID Support \ud83e\udeaa\\n\\nThe wallboxes from Easee and Warp can now also use evcc\'s [RFID function for vehicle detection](/docs/guides/vehicles#detection-via-rfid--nfc).\\n\\n## Improved phase handling (1P/3P)\\n\\nThe first version of phase switching for supported wallboxes has been available in evcc since mid last year. We were able to gain some experience and based on this we did [a major redesign](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/pull/2613) of the mechanism in February. This makes phase switching much more reliable and also behaves better in situations with unknown or implausible configuration or measurement values.\\n\\n## Templates and documentation\\n\\n[In December](/blog/2021/12/12/version-0-73#evcc-configure) we laid the foundations for a simpler initial setup with the CLI setup wizard `evcc configure`.\\n\\nThe configuration syntax of evcc is very flexible and powerful. For example, not yet officially supported devices can often be connected purely by configuration if you know the corresponding Modbus fields and JSON structures of the interface. In the now archived `evcc-io/config` repository we had collected example configurations that you could copy and paste into your own configuration.\\n\\nTogether with the command line wizard we introduced the concept of **templates**. Templates allow us to encapsulate boilerplate and internal device knowledge (protocols, address, data types, field names) in a clean way. The following example for setting up a Solarlog grid meter illustrates the change quite well:\\n\\nBefore:\\n\\n```yaml\\nmeters:\\n  - name: my_solarlog\\n    type: custom\\n    power:\\n      source: calc\\n      add:\\n        - source: modbus\\n          uri: 192.168.0.77:502\\n          id: 1\\n          register:\\n            address: 3502\\n            type: input\\n            decode: uint32s\\n          scale: -1\\n        - source: modbus\\n          uri: 192.168.0.77:502\\n          id: 1\\n          register:\\n            address: 3518\\n            type: input\\n            decode: uint32s\\n```\\n\\nAfter:\\n\\n```yaml\\nmeters:\\n  - name: my_solarlog\\n    type: template\\n    template: solarlog\\n    usage: grid\\n    host: 192.168.0.77\\n```\\n\\nThe user now only needs to know the hostname or IP address of his Solarlog instance and enter it - protocol and data structure are encapsulated in the `solarlog` template.\\n\\nAdditionally, templates also receive a structured description of all required and optional parameters, as well as default values and localized help texts.\\n\\n[Since March](https://github.com/evcc-io/docs/pull/92) we have converted the [device documentation at docs.evcc.io](/docs/devices/chargers) to templates. The previous syntaxes still work of course. Since future features like the web-based setup (yes, that will come \ud83d\ude04) are based on `type: template` we recommend that you convert your existing configurations to the new format already now.\\n\\n## New localization: Lithuanian \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddf9\\n\\nWith v0.91 we received a new localization. The evcc UI is now also available in Lithuanian. This is now the fourth language in addition to German, English and Italian. Many thanks [RTTTC](https://github.com/RTTTC) \ud83d\udc9a.\\n\\nSince our language knowledge is relatively limited, we are always grateful for translation contributions. There is currently no documentation for this, but if you are interested, just take a look at [RTTC\'s Pull Request](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/pull/3205).\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nSome of you may have already seen it. With the next release evcc will get a completely redesigned user interface. This is already available in the current nightly builds and you can find [here](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions/3149) and [here](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/pull/2889) information about the development process.

F\xfcr Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS) und macOS gibt es nun eine deutlich vereinfachte Installation. So unterst\xfctzt **evcc** nun die Installation \xfcber die Paketmanager `apt` unter Linux und [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) unter macOS.\\n\\nHierf\xfcr haben wir die Installationsanleitungen nochmals \xfcberarbeitet und damit die Installation weiter vereinfacht. Schaut doch mal in der [dazugeh\xf6rigen Dokumentation](/docs/installation) vorbei.\\n\\n## Einfachere Konfiguration\\n\\nAuch die Einrichtung von **evcc** war bisher noch sehr technisch gepr\xe4gt. Seien es die Formatierungsvorgaben von [YAML](https://yaml.org), welches die Synthax der Konfigurations vorgibt, oder die Ausgestaltung und Anpassung der Konfiguration der eigenen Ger\xe4te in der Konfigurationsdatei. F\xfcr den ein oder anderen sind das doch recht hohe H\xfcrden. Aber das Projektk ist noch jung und das Team \xfcberschaubar, vor allem wenn man bedenkt dass dies f\xfcr die Entwickler \\"nur\\" ein Hobby ist.\\n\\nUm diese H\xfcrden etwas zu minimieren, f\xfchren wir mit dieser neuen Version 0.72 von **evcc** eine neue Funktionalit\xe4t ein: Die gef\xfchrte Konfiguration mit `evcc configure`.\\n\\nMit diesem Kommando l\xe4sst sich interaktiv eine funktionierende Konfigurationsdatei f\xfcr die eigene Installation erstellen! Es gibt sicher hier und da noch einige Probleme und Fehler, aber wir hoffen es ist ein guter erster Schritt in die richtige Richtung.\\n\\n## Download & Installation\\n\\n- [Debian, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi](/docs/installation/linux)\\n- [macOS Homebrew](/docs/installation/macos)\\n- [Docker, Synology](/docs/installation/docker)\\n- [Manuell (inkl.

Und er h\xe4tte sich nicht ertr\xe4umen k\xf6nnen was dieses Projekt bisher f\xfcr einen Weg genommen hat. \xdcber 1300 Commits sp\xe4ter, mit inzwischen [369 Stars](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/stargazers), [90 Forks](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/network/members), [34 Contributors](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/graphs/contributors) und mehr als [70 Releases](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/releases) w\xe4chst **evcc** immer weiter.\\n\\nAuch die Zahl der Anwender w\xe4chst, auch wenn wir hier keine genauen Zahlen haben (und das muss auch nicht sein). Aber das [Forum](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/discussions) z\xe4hlt auch schon fast 450 Diskussionen mit vielen Teilnehmern. Auch in unserem [Entwickler Slack Channel](https://evcc.io/slack) tummeln sich viele Interessierte.\\n\\n## Neue Dokumentation\\n\\nUm dieser Breite an Personen, vor allem auch hinsichtlich dem jeweiligen technischen Hintergrund, einen besseren Zugang zu \\\\*_evcc_ zu geben, haben wir begonnen eine neue Dokumentation auf [docs.evcc.io](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/Home) auf Basis von dem Open Source Projekt [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) aufzubauen.\\n\\nWir haben folgende Bereiche eingerichtet:\\n\\n- **Erste Schritte**: Installation und Konfiguration von **evcc**.\\n- **Anleitungen**: Verschiedene Themen und H\xe4ufige Fragen.\\n- **Ger\xe4te**: Eine Liste der bekannten, unterst\xfctzten Ger\xe4te und derer Konfiguration.\\n- **Referenz**: All die (auch technischen) Details und Konfigurationsm\xf6glichkeiten, f\xfcr diejenidgen die etwas mehr in die Tiefe gehen wollen.\\n\\nWir w\xfcrden uns freuen wenn ihr uns hierbei unterst\xfctzt. Ob es sich um Korrekturen von Rechtschreibfehlern oder neuen besseren Inhalten handelt, die Dokumentation ist ebenfalls auf Github unter [github.com/evcc-io/docs](https://github.com/evcc-io/docs) zu finden und wir freuen uns \xfcber euer Mitwirken!\\n\\n## Blog\\n\\nZus\xe4tzlich er\xf6ffnen wir heute dieses Blog. Hier wird es in unregelm\xe4\xdfigen Abst\xe4nden verschiedene Inhalte rund um **evcc** und Themen rund um das Laden zu Hause geben. Wir haben ein paar Ideen, lasst euch \xfcberraschen. Unser Hauptaugenmerkt bleibt jedoch auf der Entwicklung von **evcc** selbst. Aber einen Blick hinter die Kulissen, ist sicher auch immer wieder f\xfcr den ein oder anderen interessant :)"}]}')}}]);
