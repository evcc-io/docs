With OCPP the connection will be established from charger (client) to evcc (server).
The charger needs to be able to reach evcc via the host name (functioning DNS resolution required!) or via the IP address on port 8887.
By default, the first incoming connection with any station identifier is used.
In order to be able to clearly assign several charging points, the respective station identifier (`stationid: `) and connector number (`connector: `) must be configured.
Many wallboxes automatically add the `station id` to the backend URL, some have to do this manually `ws://<evcc>:8887/<stationid>`.
If the charger supports sending metering values, try to adjust the interval to a short time span (< 10s) .
Use your RFID tags (this allows e.g. vehicle identification) or set your charger to "free charging" or "autostart" to generate the transaction required for charging release.

If the charger does not offer any option to start transactions locally, the `remotestart` advanced option can be used to automatically start a transaction as soon as a vehicle is connected.
This should only be necessary in exceptional cases.

Requirements:
* If necessary, remove previously configured OCPP profiles (e.g. used for a different backend connection) in the charger configuration
* Backend URL (Central System) in the charger configuration: `ws://[evcc-adresse]:8887/` (possibly add `stationid`)
* Protocol: OCPP-J v1.6, ocpp16j, JSON, Websocket, ws:// or similar
* No encryption, no authentication, no password
* Local network connection

The specific configuration and the actual usable functionality depend on the charger model and its software.

## Template Parameter `ocpp`

| Name | Explanation | Value | Optional |
|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Station ID<br/>`stationid` | Station ID of the charging point. Only required if multiple OCPP charging stations are set up to assign them correctly. A single OCPP charging station can also be automatically assigned. Note: In exceptional cases, it may be necessary to manually append this ID to the OCPP URL of the charging station in the form `ws://<evcc-address>:8887/<stationid>`. Most charging stations automatically add the ID internally. | Beispiel: `EVB-P12354` | no |
| Connector number<br/>`connector` | For charging stations with multiple connectors. Counting starts at 1 for the first connector. | Standard: `1` | no |
| Start remote transaction on vehicle connection<br/>`remotestart` | Only enable this option if there is no way to initiate transactions from the charger side! This is only the case if e.g. no RFID reader is available and charging processes would have to be released individually via app. Normally, the charger should always be configured at the device so that either an RFID card is used for activation or the charger is set to "Autostart", "Free Charging" or similar.

| Timeout for registration<br/>`connecttimeout` | Timeout for the registration of the charging point | Standard: `5m` | no |
| Transmission interval for meter values<br/>`meterinterval` | Time interval for transmission of meter values (MeterValueSampleInterval) | Standard: `10s` | no |
| Meter values for transmission<br/>`metervalues` | Manual specification of the meter values to be configured (MeterValuesSampledData) | Beispiel: `Energy.Active.Import.Register,Power.Active.Import,SoC,Current.Offered,Power.Offered,Current.Import,Voltage` | no |
